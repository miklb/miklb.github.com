So a supervisor of elections uncovers more security issues with electronic voting machines, and our elected leader's answer is to pass a bill preventing independent testing of the equipment.  Real bloody smart.  I'm all for technological advancements in all areas of government, but I also want to know that the technology is secure.  Which means testing, and more testing.  Rather than a knee jerk reaction and getting into bed with a company because of questionable lobbying practices, or the like.  I really hope this bill has limited support, and state reps shoot this down quickly.
