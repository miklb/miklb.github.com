I've switched my feeds to <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">feedburner</a>, for a variety of reasons.  I'm hoping whom ever has already subscribed (one or two of you at least :) ) will get the new feed with no problems, and I'm testing it out myself.  I've only ever used feedburner for new sites, so let's hope this goes off without a hitch.
Speaking of feeds, I recently mentioned <a href="http://share.opml.org">Share your OPML</a>, well, I signed up, and it's kinda interesting.  I like the similar feeds feature.  It compares your file to others, and then returns a list of people's feeds.  So you can read through other's list, and find feeds you might interested in.  (As if I didn't have enough to read now!)
