<img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/mattel_football.jpg" class="right" alt="mattel_football" />I must have worn out at least 3 of Mattel's little hand held football games when I was a kid.  Probably had another 2 confiscated from teachers for playing it during class.

So it's no surprise that I'm stoked to see that there is a game for the iPhone heavily influenced by said handheld, and it's <strong>free this weekend</strong> to boot.  <a href="http://www.touchgrove.com/">TouchGrove</a> is offering their version based on the game, (oh yeah, there was a sequel that was kick butt) until February 2.  Normally only $0.99, this seems like a great marketing plan, as they offer several other games based on similar hand held devices.  For instance I wouldn't have known that they are working on a baseball game based on a similar handheld which I totally will buy!
