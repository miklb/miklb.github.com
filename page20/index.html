    <div class="e-content">
        <p>I’ll start by saying I don’t know much about the subject, but am posting this in the hopes that someone who does can elucidate the issue.  My basic dilemma is that I have a short bit of code on my single page templates that checks to see if a visitor is from Twitter, and if so, show a little message.  (Not an original idea, I think I saw it on a post at Smashing Magazine).  The code they used didn’t work, but with the help of <a href="http://mattread.com/">BigJibby</a> in the Habari IRC channel, I was able to get it working with Habari.</p>

<p>I more or less forgot about it, until a few people noticed it and asked if it was a plugin.  When I replied it wasn’t, they asked if I could make it into one.  So it went into a to-do list I keep of Habari related ideas.  This evening I began working on it, and while troubleshooting how to actually output something to the entry single template (that’s a whole other can of worms), I discovered the code snippet wasn’t working.  With the help of <a href="http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/">Michael</a>, we discovered the problem wasn’t with the code snippet, rather it was with the URL shorteners.  Twitter recently started defaulting to <a href="http://bit.ly">Bit.ly</a>, and I recently began experimenting with <a href="http://tr.im">Tr.im</a>,  <span class="pquote-r">both of which weren’t sending twitter.com as the referrer.  Rather, due to their 301 redirect they return <strong>NULL</strong>.  Which in a nut shell sucks. </span></p>

<p>Somehow Google Analytics is able to track referrals from Twitter, as last week when I had a huge upsurge in traffic from the popularity of the <a href="http://miklb.com/infinite-summer-bookmarks">Infinite Summer Bookmarks</a>, I’m seeing 50 visitors from Twitter the first day (of the 785, by far a record for this little weblog).</p>

<p>At this point, finishing the plugin seems moot, as the only way to be sure that visitors will actually see the message would be to use a URL shortener that doesn’t return NULL, of which, the only one we found that to not be the case was Owen’s <a href="http://pastoid.com">Pastoid</a>.  I didn’t test Tinyurl, nor was I interested in looking for others.  The disappointment had already set in.  Besides that, if you are auto posting to Twitter with a plugin, you wouldn’t have the option to use a different shortener.</p>

<p>So kind readers/stumble-uponers, if anyone has a solution to this problem, please enlighten me.  Meanwhile, I’ll work out the issue with Habari and my desire to output content on a single entry template within the content output, not above the body tag.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in the snippet of code I am using:</p>

<p><code>if ( parse_url($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], PHP_URL_HOST) == 'twitter.com' ) {
	    echo "&lt;h2 class='twittervisit'&gt;Welcome, Twitter visitor! If this post is useful, don't hesitate to retweet!&lt;/h2&gt;";
</code></p>

        <p>It’s always great to see new themes released for Habari, even if they are ports.  <a href="http://blog.florian-fiegel.net/theme-clean-home-habari">Florian has ported the WordPress theme Clean Home</a> to Habari.  The theme’s name aptly describes the design, a clean, black and white two column design with contrasting red headings.  The theme seems to be coded for trunk, that is, using the areas feature.  One thing I noticed is that the theme still has some cruft from WP, calling for a dynamic sidebar (widgets) with some text that also references a text widget and and admin options.  I of all people can understand though of wanting to get something out before working out all the kinks, so I’m sure he’ll update it as soon as the areas/blocks feature is fleshed out a bit more.  I also don’t speak German, so it’s quite possible he references that in the post announcing the release.</p>

        <p><strong>FIXED</strong> Thanks to <a href="http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/">Michael</a> for pointing out the broken link on the download.  Now fixed.</p>

<p><img alt="Mail_TB_web.png" src="http://miklb.com/user/files/Mail_TB_web1.png" class="right" />Yesterday over at <a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2009/06/23/roll-your-own-mail-stamp-icon/">Hawk Wings</a> they posted an entry on how to roll your own custom Mail.app icon, with a link to a .psd template.  I personally don’t use Mail.app, rather I’ve been running the nightly build of <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/3.0b2/">Thunderbird 3</a> for quite some time.  The nightly is actually called <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/3.0a3/">Shredder</a> and is, quite possibly, the worst icon in the world, so when I saw the Hawk Wings post, I jumped at the chance to customize my icon.</p>

<p>I’m not sure anyone else would care to change their icon up, but you can <a href="http://miklb.com/user/downloads/Mail_TB.zip">download my alternate Thunderbird icon</a>.  Hawk Wings has a link in that post on how to change icons in Mac OS X for those new to Mac.</p>

What free time I did have was either spent  in a bar, or reading cookbooks and trade publications to further my knowledge base.  However, it also meant I got away from reading fiction in any form.  Today, my reading is solely relegated to reading online, and non-fiction for the most part.</p>

<p>This summer however, that changes.  I’m not even sure how I came across it, but a few people put together the idea of collectively reading ( a book club if you will) <cite>Infinite Jest</cite>, by David Foster Wallace.  <a href="http://infinitesummer.org/">Infite Summer</a> is really a brilliant idea, and just another example of some of the great things about the internet and “social media”.</p>

<p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/infsum_bookmark.jpg" class="left" alt="bookmark" />I’ll be reading along with everyone else, as well as with my fiancée.  We ordered our copies a few weeks ago, and it’s been tough to not get started, but one of the premises of Infinite Summer is 75 pages a week, with discussion along the way (the book is 1000 pages, which is how the 75 pages a week idea came about—breaking the book into digestible chunks).  The site will have guest writers as well as a forum, so I really wanted to follow the guide.  The reading is to start Sunday, which brings me to the whole point of this post.</p>

<p>The “official” schedule <a href="http://infinitesummer.org/archives/168">was posted on Monday</a>, that is, what page number corresponded with each ending week.  It also will mark the cut off for “spoilers”.  Nothing beyond that page will be discussed in the posts or in the general discussion area.  They followed up with a post <a href="http://infinitesummer.org/archives/215">How to Read Infinite Jest</a>, which recommends using bookmarks, several of them.</p>

<p>So I got the idea to make bookmarks.  My fianceé was looking for a way to save the schedule without having to check back to the website, so I figured putting it on the bookmark would be convenient.  A quick Google search turned up <a href="http://asnailpace.com/blog/968/">Stephen LeQuier’s 2009 Photoshop calendar template</a>.  A few modifications later, along with some simple graphics to match the Infinite Summer logo (which itself is a play on one of the edition’s cover), and I had myself a handy bookmark.</p>

<p>I’ll be the first to say I’m not a print designer (some would argue I’m not a designer at all), so apologies in advance if the quality isn’t the finest.  My printer is in need of ink, so I’ve only done some tests to make sure the size would be OK.  But I’m thinking that printed on some heavy paper or card stock would be sufficient to allow them to last the 3 months they’ll be in use.</p>

<p>I’m offering 2 downloads, both in .pdf format.  A single version that <em>might</em> be able to be opened in PS with the layers intact, and a version with 5 on it.  Why 5?  Well, the guide to reading suggests multiple bookmarks, and well, I was able to fit 5 on a page.</p>

<p>Anyway, perhaps others will find them useful.</p>

<p><a href="http://miklb.com/user/downloads/infsum_bookmark.pdf">Download the single bookmark file.</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://miklb.com/user/downloads/5x_infsum_bookmark.pdf">Download the multiple bookmark file</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any problems with the download, or the .pdf, leave a comment and I can see about offering other formats like .jpg.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you haven’t already planned to join the Infinite Summer, it’s not too late to get to the book store and read along with the rest of us.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>  Matthew contacted me and reminded me that in the reading guide, there’s a pivotal point in the book on page 223.  (No, I followed the guide and didn’t turn to the page to read it!)  What ever is contained within that page is apparently something that the reader will need to refer back to often and he asked if I could update the bookmark once we reach that point in the schedule, which is July 13th.  So on July 13th, check back for an updated copy of the bookmark for your main page that will contain that information.  I’ll remove the June calendar to make room, Matthew says the information is quite brief.</p>

<p>Thank you for all who’ve commented so far, I’m quite happy to see so many people interested in the bookmarks and participating in Infinite Summer.</p>

<p>Also, I’ll be writing up a post on how I’m using <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> to organize my thoughts and keep notes as I read.</p>
