I cobbled this design out of something else I was working on, to break out of the constraints of using someone else's work, but intend on something extrordinary for the site, especially the oft-not  used <a href="http://www.miklb.com">entry page</a>.  So I signed up for the <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS Reboot</a> as a means of having a tangible goal, as well as some pressure to knock one out of the park.  So things won't change much around here until May, but check back then for a whole new miklb.com.
