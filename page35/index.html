        Installing Ubuntu on my Mac

    <div class="e-content">
        <p><a href="/user/images/3_operating_systems.jpg"><img class="right" src="/user/images/3_operating_systems_sm.jpg" alt="" /></a>The “blogosphere” has been abuzz the last few weeks with news of the latest release of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu, 7.10, <em>Gutsy Gibbon</em></a>, and curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to see if I could install it on my mac mini, since I didn’t have another machine to try it out on.  I’m quite happy with Mac OS, but it never hurts to be familiar with other operating systems.  So I thought aloud on the Habari IRC channel if I could use <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a>, which I use to run Windows XP, only so I can test websites in Internet Explorer 6.  Survey said, “why not”, and I gave it a go.
<!-- more -->
First step was to download the installer disc from the Ubuntu site, which is in the .iso format.  There are many ways to create an actual CD from this, or a .dmg file, however I didn’t want to bother with that step, so after another question to the IRC channel, my friend <a href="http://h0bbel.p0ggel.org">Christian</a> said Virual Box should load from the .iso, and quickly found a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vincentt/416553085/">Flickr image</a> showing how to set the VM to load from the .iso. (After you’ve created the new VM, click the settings button, then for CD/DVD-ROM, check the mount CD/DVD-ROM, then check the ISO image, and find the file you downloaded.)  I haven’t gone through the steps to setting up a new VM in Virtual Box as I just used their wizard for a new VM.  I did give a bit more RAM for the VM than the default setting, as I’ve got 2GB, and won’t be using the VM that often, so figured I could spare some. I’m sure I did the same thing for the XP install as well.</p>

<p>Now that the VM is set to run off of the .iso, I started the VM, and Ubuntu quickly loaded, with a prompt to Install/Boot from disc (I think that’s what it said), hitting enter, Ubuntu booted up.  You can run just off of the CD image, if your curiosity is small, however, you can actually run the installer from the icon on the desktop, to get the full experience.</p>

<p>Clicking on the installer walks you through the basic installer, not unlike installing Mac OS or Windows.  The installer took just under an hour in the VM from the CD image, I’m not sure more RAM or an actual CD would have sped the process up or not.  After the installer is done running, you will be prompted to restart, with a notice to eject the CD, so that you don’t run off of the CD.  Since Virtual Box is set to use the ISO, you will need to shut down the VM, change the setting to use the host CD/DVD-ROM, and restart the Ubuntu VM.  You should be prompted to enter your username and password that you set up during the installation process, and Ubuntu should now be running in your VM.</p>

<p>My initial reaction to Ubuntu 7.1 is that it’s a mix of Tiger and Windows XP in feel, maybe 75% Mac, 25% XP.  I haven’t explored much more yet, but have looked a bit at a <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/the_perfect_desktop_ubuntu_gutsy_gibbon">tutorial for the “perfect desktop”</a>, and will certainly poke around.  I think I’m more interested now in exploring virtual machines, and other operating systems than I am with playing with Ubuntu, however, I don’t see myself leaving Mac OS any time soon.    Feel free to comment if you have any problems with Virtual Box, though I only have a basic understanding of it, but I’ll try to share my experience.</p>

    <time datetime="2007-09-15T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">15 Sep 2007</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p><strong>updated:</strong> New versions available.  See bottom of post for details.
<strong>&lt;h2&gt;Mzingi development will no longer done on Bloggingmeta, as it’s now included in Habari’s core theme directory.  Any bugs, comments, or suggestions should be pointed to <a href="http://trac.habariproject.org/habari">Trac</a>&lt;/h2&gt;</strong></p>

<p>I have had the idea for a foundation type theme for Habari since I first started working with the platform earlier in the year.  After spending time converting k2 to the design for this site, as well as for my &lt;a href://cookingwith.miklb.com”&gt;cooking site&lt;/a&gt;, I knew that if I wanted to continue working on Habari theme design, I would need something else to work off of.  No offense at all intended for the developers and users of k2, I have extreme respect for what it has achieved, I simply feel that it’s conversion to Habari was a difficult task, considering the advanced features in k2, vs being adapted to Habari at such an early stage.  <a href="http://andrewdasilva.com/">Andrew (aka freakrz)</a>, has done great work in advancing k2 to catch up to where the rest of Habari development is, however, I still felt I wanted my own framework to work off of.</p>

<p><a href="http://miklb.com/user/images/mzingi_screenshot.jpg"><img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/screenshot_thumb.jpg" class="left" alt="screenshot" /></a>That said, I took the initial work I had done here on Blogging Meta, and started working on a purely CSS based theme, that could be used out of the box, as well as be flexible enough to be used as a framework.  I still have a long way to go in the design world, but trying to use all of the reading I’ve done, I think the markup is fairly semantic, HTML strict, and though the CSS validator chokes on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/">YUI font CSS</a>, it should be valid CSS as well.  I quite like the simple percentage based font sizing of the YUI CSS, as well as the built in font family cascading.  Again, still plenty to learn in this direction, and perhaps at some point I’ll drop it, but it’s a good building block (perhaps after getting some time to mature, as well allow me to spend some time with it, I’ll convert to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blue Print CSS</a> framework).
<!--more-->
Aside from the YUI CSS, the only other borrowed code is from <a href="http://andybudd.com">Andy Budd’s</a> <a href="http://www.cssmastery.com/">CSS Mastery</a> chapter on forms.  However, this will soon be removed, as I want the license for the theme to be completely compatible with the Apache License that Habari ships with, and Andy’s code is licensed under a Creative Commons share-a-like one. (A completely different subject, which I intend to blog about soon enough.)  However, for the short term, the form is quite nice, and will suffice until I can write my own CSS for it.  There was also a subconscious nod to the excellent <a href="http://ifelse.co.uk/simpla">Simpla</a> WordPress theme by Phy Ly, though no conscious code borrowed from the design.</p>

<p>Also, many thanks to everyone on the #habari IRC channel for tips, tricks, and code help, particularly tinyau for helping with the comment form and ringmaster for help with the tag template code.</p>

<p>A few notes about the theme.  The theme assumes the use of the tag “aside” for the asides in the sidebar, if you want to change that tag, you would need to edit theme.php and sidebar.php to change the corresponding tag.  Likewise, if you want fewer or more asides or recent comments listed in the sidebar, you will need to edit those values in theme.php.  I tried to comment the file to outline what the various additions are.  There’s also the addition of the ability to an excerpt, as can be seen on the tag page.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, the first, alpha release of the theme is now available.  I’m sure minor updates will come soon, but my impatience overcomes my need for perfection.</p>

        <p>A few months ago, I came across <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme">Jon Hicks’ Mac inspired Google Reader</a>, but recently noticed the version I was using was outdated, and Google Reader wasn’t looking so hot.  Off I went in search of an update, and subsequent posts on Jon’s site, found <a href="http://userstyles.org">User Styles</a>.  Though the site could use some better search functionality, I really like it in the sense that you can easily add styles via the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108">Stylish</a> extension for Firefox.  I’ve employed <a href="http://miklb.com/custom-style-sheets-and-basecamp">Stylish for BaseCamp</a>, and have thought more about how it could be used, User Styles gives plenty to think about now.</p>
