In this cultural wasteland of Outback Steakhouses and strip malls, the "major" museums only seem to make the papers when a city spends millions for an artists rendering and design, only to be scraped.  Leave it to an exhibit put together by the curator of the St. Petersburg Mueseum of Fine Art to find its way into the New York Times, of all places.  Is it not enough that our local musicians have to move there to get any notice, now our museum exhibits too?
