    <p>So the new feature in GMAIL is the “web clip”.  Not really sure what it is, other than RSS feeds based on content of your mail.  So when checking your SPAM folder before deleting, you now get recipes for “Savory Spam Crescents”, and “Ginger Spam Salad”, too funny.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html">del.icio.us: y.ah.oo!</a>
So the ‘net is abuzz that the hot tagging service del.icio.us was bought by yahoo.  Read through the comments, some are skeptical, some simply full of congrats, some outright damning the merger.  Me, eh, I’ll wait to see what happens, but will start trying to get <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/">scuttle</a>    working again, just in case.  I’ve been using <a href="http://www.blinklist.com">Blinklist</a> as well, and there’s no shortage of options out there, if yahoo does get too hands on.  I really don’t see it as this commenter &lt;blockquote&gt;What happened to the decentralization the internet was supposed to be so good for?&lt;/blockquote&gt;because, as I’ve said, there are other options out there, and will continue to grow, especially after this buy-out.</p>

I’d like to know a little more about the “efforts” of the DoD to connect soldiers with their citizenship.  While I commend the 79% that did their civic duty, and perhaps will make it a habit after they leave the military, I doubt the sincerity of the DoD’s reasons.  You had to be living in a cave in Afganhistan, (oops, no, they knew about it too) to not know about the slim margin Bush “won” by in ‘00, and the discussions of the military often voting Republican, etc, etc, etc.  So Rummy made a concerted effort to “get out the vote” as soon as the war started, hoping that the patriotism and general tendacies would help him keep his job for 4 more years.  Now that his job is not on the line, and the undertone of the politcal landscape is in much darker, I wonder if the DoD will make such a push for election turnout.  And more so, I wonder if the Dems can pressure the DoD to maintain the “program”, and turn the knife, so to speak, on the administration.</p>
