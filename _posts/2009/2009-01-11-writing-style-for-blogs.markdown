Interestingly enough, <a href="http://asymptomatic.net/2009/01/10/2780/why-cant-it">Owen writes about his blogging style</a>; I was remarking the other night that no wonder no one reads my blog, the posts are too long.

I've been trying to blog more, but tend to write these long diatribes, which smack against the conventions of online writing that I've read.  I used to tell myself that I blogged for my own benefit, and that I didn't care if anyone read it, but I'm fooling myself.  Every time I write something, I find myself checking stats and looking for comments, so obviously I do care. To that end I am also looking to tailor my blogging style to cater to easier digestion, regular readership and the potential for a discussion to ensue.

I have a <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2008/03/15/21/">few references</a> (actually, Bleacher Report has quite a bit of good reference, be it sports related or not), but am looking for more.  Do you have any quality references for online writing?

<em>Update</em> - I've found a few links that have some good information.
<ul>
<li>A collection of articles by<a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/"> Jakob Nielsen on writing for the web</a></li>
<li>Actually linked from the previous set of articles, but worthy of listing again, <a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v1/articles/web-writing-for-many-interest-levels.htm">web writing for many interest levels</a>, is very informative.  I particularly like the methodology list.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/contribute/styleguide/">A List Apart's style guide</a></li>
</ul>

I'll update this list as I find additional resources.
