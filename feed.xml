My initial goals were to have a framework for myself that was fully microformats 2 compliant to build my own site off of and to share a starting point for anyone new to having their own website and wanting to embrace IndieWeb themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I know of one person who is using it, which is encouragement enough to continue looking at ways to improve it. In the upcoming release of Jekyll, themes will be supported. While considered a minor enhancement, I think its a major milestone for Jekyll. Previously, there was no simple way to change the look and feel of your site without manually copying files into your install. Most theme projects are packaged as standalone Jekyll builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that said, my plan moving forward to is to package the microformated theme, complete with the same config options as a Gem under the name “Crier” (as in town crier. Not sure it’s anymore imaginative than the original project.) The original GitHub project will switch to the Gem once the new version is released, but will stay as a standalone Jekyll install for anyone who wants to get started from scratch. Also, Tom began working implementing a webmention gem for sending while at &lt;a href=&quot;https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2016/06/07/indieweb-summit-2016-demos/&quot;&gt;IndieWeb Summit 2016&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of Bear in the IndieWeb community, I hope to have a tutorial and example of using continuous integration to build and deploy a site back to GitHub allowing the sending of webmentions along with the already supported receiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear from anyone else interested in the project or using it, and what else you would like to see. Long term goal is micropub support.&lt;/p&gt;

Siri this, iOS 10 that. And I’m sure some of the ideas are great and I’ll be happy when they are at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all I want is for Apple to include the font from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/&quot;&gt;WWDC web site&lt;/a&gt;. When the site launched, it took me some time to realize the page is a giant image. A simple monospaced font on a background you’d find in a terminal or code editor app. It’s beautiful and I want it for my own.&lt;/p&gt;

I would have loved to attend in person, but a cross country flight wasn’t in the cards. Fortunately, the organizers have long had plans in place to accommodate remote attendance by providing live video feeds of demonstrations as well as covering a couple of the breakout sessions on Saturday. IWC also has a robust IRC channel which will facilitate participation on build day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary goals beyond furthering my understanding of the technologies behind the IndieWeb is to switch back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://webmention.io&quot;&gt;webmention.io&lt;/a&gt; for receiving webmentions. Aaron Gustafson updated his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io&quot;&gt;Jekyll plugin&lt;/a&gt; and I like the idea of cached mentions as well as the idea of using progressive enhancement in displaying them. This will entail taking the mentions from the current tool and formatting them to match Aaron’s cache file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I want to wrap my head around syndicating from micropub and begin to use it more. I believe there is a workflow out there, I just need to fully understand how to wire them all the bits together. If time permits, also in the micropub realm, I want to get mobile publishing set up.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile I had launched my first blog with WordPress, fresh off the 1.5 release that brought full themes, XHTML and CSS. Reading blog posts on the subjects was basically the way I learned those skills. And viewing the page source of the authors writing those posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2016, and I still view source. More often than not now, I’m learning from GitHub repositories. Which is why finding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree&quot;&gt;Octotree&lt;/a&gt; browser plugin was such a find. Rather than having to navigate back and forth inside a repo, you get a tree view of the files to the left of the browser window. If you find your self using the back button and navigating breadcrumbs, I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;
