<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12416-2005Apr23.html">Washington Post (4/24/05)</a> Ah, I've been busy, but not too busy to keep an eye on "The Hammer".  It appears all his "aw,  shucks, I didn't know" posturing has once again, come back to bite him in the hind quarters.  You are telling me that if you go to play golf at St. Andrews, with your former chief of staff, not to mention other lobbyists, that you don't know who's pickin' up the bill? 
  Buckham should have known in the first place that he should be very particular who's card, what account, the visit was being charged to.  Of all people, he should have known, and been sure to tell DeLay, "Hey, Tom, this part of the trip, I'm not sure how we are paying for it, I think it's coming out of my pocket.  Make sure you pay for your round yourself, we'll take care of it once we get back in the states, but just to be sure, you know?"  That is, if the trip was really all up and up as Delay sheepishly states it has been.
But put those three together on a golf course across the ocean, and there's a few more skirtings of the rules beside a few mulligans going on.
