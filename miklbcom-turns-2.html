Thinking back on it all, I’ve come a long way, and look forward to where things go.  To any and all who’ve visited and commented, thanks.  I’ve recently tried to blog more in general, and also realized that the site is in need of some overhauling, as I’ve not really done much with the design/updating in almost a year.
