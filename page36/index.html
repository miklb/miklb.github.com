            <p>For many reasons, I have not used the streaming music from <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>.  That is, until today.  I first read a <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060507110841475">hint</a> on how to use iTunes and Apple Scripts, however, that solution didn’t work.  Another comment on the hint pointed to <a href="http://amua.sourceforge.net/">Amua</a>, which basically streams the music via iTunes.  Excellent stuff.  I now can stream my last.fm music through my stereo, using the Airport Express.  If you are a last.fm user, by all means, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/miklb">add me as a friend</a>, or at least check out my musical tastes.  Though still a bit buggy, my <a href="http://miklb.com/lifestream">Lifestream</a> also tracks my most currently played selections.</p>

            <p>Can someone please tell <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/">The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> to start a new iPhone blog, and leave my feedreader free of half a dozen or more posts everyday about the iPhone?  I appreciate the need for constant updating, but certainly, you don’t have to post everytime someone who owns an iPhone coughs.</p>

            <p>It seems that there is quite the difference in how Habari is developed from a PHP standpoint to a design standpoint.  Code wise, most major changes that I’ve seen, a patch was sent out to the community, and comments were made about how it worked, and if it worked within the general scope of where the members and community saw development.</p>
            <p>This has not been the  case, from what I can see, with a current movement to change the entire admin interface.  There was some discussion about the possibility of incorporating <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">BluePrint CSS Framework</a> into the admin interface.  The general consensus was that it wasn’t a bad idea, but that there were concerns with it’s compatibilities with all browsers.  In that discussion however, there was no talk of a “live” redesign of the interface.  Meaning, the admin would be changed in trunk, at small increments, without any discussion of the changes, or the effects of those changes on the user experience.</p>

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>Recently, a friend with a slightly larger budget than I, bought an iPhone.  Subsequently, they gave me their “old” Nokia e62. I’ve been a big fan of Nokia, simply because most of their phones that I’ve owned were well constructed, worked well with Cingular, and, just <em>worked</em>.</p>
            <p>So quickly I discovered I can now sync my address book and iCal with the phone, which is nice.  I then sought as many means as possible to use the phone with my mac.  One downfall with Nokia, is they do not have a native Mac desktop interface, as they do with PC, but at least they’ve recently added a <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4423135">Media Manager</a>, which allows for the addition of a folder in iTunes and iPhoto , in which anything added to that folder is added to your phone.  I won’t be using the phone much for these purposes, but it’s a nice addition.  Perhaps I can see myself using it for taking a podcast or two with me for listening to while out and about.</p>
            <p>Another, not so familiar utility, is the Bluetooth File Exchange application in the Utilities folder.  When I was given the phone, I didn’t get a USB data transfer cable, so I was having difficulty adding applications to the phone.  One in particular, was a fix for sending SMS messages.  They were taking forever to send.  After discovering the File Exchange app however, I was able to navigate to the file on the harddrive, send it to device, chose the phone, and the app showed up as a text message.  Opening the application allowed me to easily install apps or add new themes (even with the new phone, I’m still suffering from iPhone envy, so I found an iPhone theme, which I actually like much better than the default theme, or any of the other included themes on the phone).</p>

            <p>I just added a link in the sidebar to an upcoming blogger “unconference”, <a href="http://blogorlando.com">BlogOrlando</a>.  I’ve not been to any type of meetup/conference/gathering of other bloggers, and am really looking forward to it.  Not only to just get out of town for a day or two, but to actually meet and talk face to face with other bloggers and web geeks.  I’ll probably concentrate on the technology aspects of the gathering, though I suppose I can sit in on other sessions as they are added and interest me.  I’m also looking forward to being able to pimp <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a>.</p>
            <p>If anyone else in the Central Florida area is going, I’d love to connect in advance, and possibly have someone to “know” in advance.  There are two dinners, one the night before, and one the night of, so having even a somewhat familiar person to break bread with would be nice, though I’m fairly good at making new acquaintances and meeting people.  (Probably from years of sitting in bars and chatting up the person next to me.)</p>
            <p>Also, if anyone has advice for attending an event of this nature, I’m all ears.</p>
