    <meta name="description" content="Sign me up.  Got the call from the local cable company, Brighthouse tonight saying that with our current package, I can add VOIP telephone and and twice as much download rates for Road Runner for basically half of what I pay monthly for my traditional phone service.  And they claim they have battery backup for phone service in case of power outage (we keep an old fashioned phone around for those just in case moments, though a cell phone now makes it less used).  How can you beat that.  And one less bill a month to deal with.So if anyone has any experience with the digital phone service, I’ve still got two weeks before they come to install, I’d really love some feedback." />
