    <meta name="description" content="There has been much buzz the past week regarding comment/trackback spam around the net.  Discussions regarding a cyber spam war, threads all over the WP support forums, and blog post after blog post regarding spam.  Meanwhile, I sit wondering am I missing out on something?  Do the spammers simply not like me?  I’ve gotten one or two Spam Karma digests, with a few caught spams over the past week, but nothing like the “100s” of spams I’ve seen people mention.  I didn’t think I was doing anything exceptional to protect against spam.  I’m running Bad Behavior and Spam Karma 2.  No Akismet, the golden child of WP lead developer Matt Mullenweg, no captchas, nothing else.Then I wonder, is it because I’ve donated to both plugin developers, that I really do have Spam Karma on my side?  Either way, know if and when I get an adsense deposit, that a portion of it will go again to both plugin developers, just in case ;-)" />
