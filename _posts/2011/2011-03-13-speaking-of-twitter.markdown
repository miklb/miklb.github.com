I finally got around to setting up <a href="http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/">Tweet Nest</a> at <a href="http://tweets.miklb.com">http://tweets.miklb.com</a>, to archive, well, my tweets.  Seems Twitter only goes back so far, so I don't have <strong>all</strong> of them, but I think I have an archive somewhere that does. May look at figuring out how to add those in at some point.  Tweet Nest is a very cool little open source app.
