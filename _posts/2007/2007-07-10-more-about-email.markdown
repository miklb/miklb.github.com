So quickly I've discovered (or been reminded), that using a Mail.app rule to move right out of the Inbox removes the notice in the dock.  Not a big deal, but if I'm away from the computer when the hour is up, I might not see that I have new work email, so I've employed <a href="http://www.tonyallevato.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=29">Mail Badger</a>, so that I can create a custom icon notice in the Mail icon in the dock just for that work's email.  So far so good though with the system.
