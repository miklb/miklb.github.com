            <p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050908-5.html">Proclamation</a> Apparently, there’s provisions that state the Labor Secretary sets a minumum wage to pay various levels of laborers and “mechanics”.  Well, Bush has suspended this provision.   It’s written into the provision that he can, and in some circumstances, I can understand why.  But we are talking about Bush, and Cheney, and I can see how some corporate contractors seize an opportunity to not pay laborers a federally mandated min. rate, but still charge their “normal” fees.  So prior to the Hurricane, a skilled worker in NO would have been paid a certain rate if working on a federal contract, now he will be paid less.  Good thing those tax cuts went to those who needed it most…</p>

            <p>So I started the WordPress “fan” site recently, <a href="http://wpstation.com">WordPress Station</a>, and recently got it its own domain.  And while surfing around, I found an open source design that was a hack of Apple’s brushed metal design.  There was a brushed metal theme for WP when I first started using it, but it’s disappeared.  Not sure why, but I figured there might be a few who’d want to give it a run.  Therefore, I’m in the process of porting it to WP, and have it in “beta” over at WPstation.  Plus, I’ve been busy working with an upstart hosting company, and will begin offering a great deal on a basic hosting package VERY soon.
Now if I could only motivate myself to post over at cookingwith more…</p>

            <p><a href="http://jacob.wordpress.com/">Jacob Appelbaum?s weblog</a>
              Jacob’s blogging from Houston, where he and some other SF Bay area volunteers are trying to team up with volunteers from Austin and surrounding areas to set up a Low Powered FM radio.  They have a license from the FCC, all the equipment, including a standing offer of 10,000 radios for the residents…the purpose, to easily disseminate information to the 10,000+ displaced New Orleans residents, now living in the Astrodome.  Seems perhaps <em>someone</em> doesn’t want some “free speech” to trickle down to those that need it.<br />
              And I haven’t heard one cable network touch on this, though it seems the LA Times have half the story.  Stay tuned.</p>
