New attempts at opening up the gulf to gas and oil drilling, this under the assumption that the current methods are "safe".  And that no accidents happened last year during the hurricanes.  Whippee.  Thankfully, even Mel Martinez is saying he will oppose the legislation, as well as most of the congressional delegation from Florida.  If they would only draft legislation taking the area off the table for X number of years, so we didn't have to hear about this every year.  If you haven't yet, be sure you've contacted your Senator and Congressman about this, or any issue you feel strongly about.
