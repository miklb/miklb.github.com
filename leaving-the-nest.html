              <p>I was humbled and honored to say the least, and so from here on out, all development for this project will be maintained by the community.</p>
              <p>Thanks to all who’ve helped, and shared their appreciation for it’s intended purpose, and I trust the community will continue to use it for creating full fledged themes.  Feels a little odd, but satisfying at the same time.</p>
