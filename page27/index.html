        <p>Without getting into the whys and hows this statement came about, I find it very simple, yet poignant and applicable to many of life’s situations.</p>
<blockquote>
We're still learning to walk, and we're going to trip every now and then and sometimes when we run, we're going to fall on our faces. But as long as we get up, try again, and learn something from the experience, in the end, skinned knees and all, it'll be worth it.

<p>Thanks <a href="http://www.morydd.net/">Sean.</a></p>

<p><em>edit</em> - might I add, I’m in a new-ish romantic relationship, which <strong>very</strong> recently hit a bump, and perhaps this analogy hit home there more than anywhere.</p>

        <p><a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2008/04/svn_notifier.php">SVN Notifiier</a> is a handy little Mac Dashboard widget that, using Growl, will notify you when a local working copy is out of date.  I’ve not quite gotten the “sticky” notice to work, but I just might need to edit the actual Growl settings.</p>

<p>Still, it’s nice to be able at a glance check your dashboard, or see a little growl notice pop up.</p>

        <p>This past week it was proposed and not shot down in flames that my first foray into a Habari theme, <a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi">mzingi</a> , intended as a simple, image free theme to be used as a foundation for building proper themes, should be included into the core download of <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a>.</p>

<p>I was humbled and honored to say the least, and so from here on out, all development for this project will be maintained by the community.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who’ve helped, and shared their appreciation for it’s intended purpose, and I trust the community will continue to use it for creating full fledged themes.  Feels a little odd, but satisfying at the same time.</p>

        <p>I recently <a href="http://miklb.com/updated-themes">updated my themes</a>, and since that time a change has been made in trunk in how pagination is handled.  All 3 three themes have been updated for this change.  I will be leaving download links for the previous versions up as well, as I <em>believe</em> those versions should work with 0.4.1.  If you experience any problems with either version, please set me know.</p>

<p>Downloads and more info on each theme available on their original post.</p>

</ul>

<p>Also, I have a <a href="http://themes.miklb.com">demo site</a> up and running to check them out.  I still need to tweak the themeswitcher plugin so you can only select certain themes from your theme directories, so note that only <strong>my 3 themes</strong> have the switcher code.</p>

        <p>I think with the help of a google search and <a href="http://blog.gruby.com/2007/12/14/bluetooth-in-vmware-fusion/">Scott Gruby</a>, I’ve figured out how to use my bluetooth keyboard in VM.</p>
<blockquote>Finally, I found a reference to inserting the Leopard DVD while in Windows. I tried this and when I did, the BootCamp driver installer came up and installed my drivers. Perfect; why couldn’t VMWare say something about this on their website?</blockquote>

<p>Thanks Scott and I agree, why isn’t this documented somewhere.</p>

<p><em>Edit 8/1/08</em>Seems you also have to disconnect the USB Bluetooth Host Controller to get it to work.  Something about only one OS can control the device at a time, so the machine gets confused when the two are both connected.  Disconnecting the controller, shutting down the XP install, then restarting VMware Fusion finally got it working.</p>
