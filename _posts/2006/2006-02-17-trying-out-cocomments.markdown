<p><a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">CoComments</a></p> is open to anyone, though they have a caveat that if server load gets too high, they'll shut down registration again.  I hadn't really paid attention to it, though I've seen it mentioned, but the concept is sound.  How often do you leave comments on a blog, and then forget where, and wonder if there was a follow up?  Happens to me all the time.  I keep tabs on several RSS feeds that a general in nature, and will drop a comment on a strangers blog often, only to fade from my memory.  Not anymore, if CoComments works as advertised.  You are given a simple bookmarklet to use before you formally submit a comment.  You then can keep track of the comments via their site, or better yet, your RSS feed.  In addition, you'll see a box in my sidebar, so visitors can see where I'm visiting and commenting.  Another way of building community, in my oh, so humble opinion.  Though, I've yet to see it in action, I've seen it on another's blog.  And I doubt it will take long before I put it in action.  So go register if interested, 'cause it could be like Google Analytics, and close with no notice.
