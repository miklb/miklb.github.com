            <p>When things are going good, they are really good.  I can’t say a bad thing about my life right now, looking forward to my classes, have a great paying job lined up that starts in a month, doing some cool stuff on the web, just over all good.  So my printer went out.  An Epson 5400 all-in-one.  Bought it about 16 months ago for $130 after rebates.  But we bought the 2 year warranty.  So, I go to trade it in today, and obviously the 5400 is an older model.  They’ve got the 6600.  Ok, they credit me the $150, the 6600 is $189 after instant rebate.  Eh, $39 isn’t bad.  But wait.  There are some mail in rebates.  How much you ask.  $110 worth!!!  So, I pay $80 out of my pocket today, will get $110 back within 6 weeks, have a brand new printer, and a 2 year no questions asked warranty.  Sweet!
Even without the trade in deal, you can get that printer for $79 through the 26th of August at CompUSA.  Still not a bad deal.</p>

I certainly wonder if all the advertising $$ that the cable news networks have taken in during segments on the Holloway case were applied to missing and exploited womens groups, what the effect would be.<br />
              That said, Costas, whom I’ve mentioned in a previous post as a solid fill in for King, turned down the gig based on the subject.  Clearly Costas wants to do “real” stories, I’m sure he gets enough fluff doing “feel good” stories for the Olympics.  Anyway, good for you Bob.</p>

            <p>So I caught part of the President’s speech today at the VFW conference today, and as the pressure is mounting on both sides of the aisle (that was Republican Chuck Hagel, Vietnam Vet, saying that Iraq was looking more and more like Vietnam, right?), and what did I hear him invoke?  Ah, the old September 11th mantra.  Is he foolish enough to think that people are still buying that, or am I foolish enough to think people have seen through the smoke screen and realize that Iraq has nothing to do Sept 11.  Either way, with all the bickering and jostling for election positions, the GOP sure isn’t sending a united message, and the Dems are still figuring out how Dean got elected to head the party.  Meanwhile, I feel we are on a ship at 1/2 throttle with the wheel tied off so we just keep going in a big circle.  Every once in a while, we see land, and think we are going to be ok, only to veer away, back to sea.  Please, can we find someone, anyone, to stand up and take the wheel?</p>

Luckily, a judge didn’t see it that way, and ruled that there was no evidence that the research from several years ago was reversed.
In a related note, a similar case was ruled on on the West Coast regarding a species of salamander, in which the administration tried to lump several species together so as to remove them from the endangered species list.<br />
              One can only assimilate that the reason to remove these species is so development can infringe on the habitat of these endangered species.  I’d like to know a little more about what kind of development that would be.</p>
