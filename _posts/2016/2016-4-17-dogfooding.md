summary: Dogfooding my IndieWeb Jekyll theme.
---

 Last night I switched over the *theme* for this site to a project I've been working on the last moth or so, [Jekyll-IndieWeb](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb). While I have different design ideas, until I find other users interested in using it, I knew I needed to work out any kinks. I also wanted to have better microformat support until the design changes. Thus
[dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).

I will write more about the project once I have more documentation (and work out any more said kinks), but the gist is I wanted to provide someone new to Jekyll with a desire to be part of the
[IndieWeb](https://indiewebcamp.com/) a solid starting point. I rely heavily on the `_config.yml` file for options a user can set - profile pic, social media links, choice to include display of webmentions - to quickly get a personal site up and running. The biggest hurdle for me was providing a minimal design that was unopinionated yet still aesthetically appealing. Anyone familiar with HTML & CSS can easily build upon or modify it, but if not, it shouldn't look *ugly*.

This has been the first solo project I've embarked on that was meant for public consumption from the start, which in itself has been a learning process. Now I just hope others can find it useful in some way. If the project interests you I encourage you to try it out, open any issues in the repo, or reach out on #indiewebcamp IRC, I tend to hang around there most days.
