I've been busy, so not much posting, but as I was doing some online reading, I came across a great web site <a href="http://www.houseofscandal.org/">www.houseofscandal.org</a>.  It is a clearinghouse of sorts, covering all things Tom DeLay.  I still can not believe the links between DeLay and the Martinez aid has gone unreported, maybe someone is sandbagging the info until an election cycle, where the information would be more useful.

I am still keeping an eye on all of it, and hope to find more on Martinez.  Until then, read up on DeLay and his shenanigans.
