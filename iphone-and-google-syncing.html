              <p>3rd party web services come and go; there’s little doubt in my mind Google isn’t going anywhere.  It uses the same Exchange server technology, so the same caveat that the previous solution had still exists.  You are only allowed one Exchange server connection, so if for some reason you are using it with say, Exchange, you won’t be able to sync your Google calendar or contacts.</p>
