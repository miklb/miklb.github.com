          <p>I just removed the HuffingtonPost from my RSS aggregator, as the Vongage ads were the last straw.  It’s bad enough I can’t get a feed with excerpts.  I know some people don’t like excerpts, but a site as prolific as HuffPo (not to mention, the “bloggers” at HuffPo are some long winded essayists)  You miss one day of reading, and there’s 30+ full length posts to wade through.  Lately, I’ve found myself ditching them anyway without even reading headlines.</p>
          <p>So why not offer a feed of your blog posts in excerpt form without ads.  If the article sounds interesting, I’ll click over the site, and you inundate me with as many ads as you like.</p>
