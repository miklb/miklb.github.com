          <p><strong>EDIT</strong> I just couldn’t take Squible anymore.  It’s a great theme, and there are aspects I do like, it’s just not me.  So I’m adapting a design I’ve been working on for something else for the time being, and will continue to tweak over the next few days.  I hope it doesn’t interupt anyone’s viewing of the more popular posts.</p>
