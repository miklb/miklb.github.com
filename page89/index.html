            <p>I never read the USA Today, online or else where, but somehow stumbled onto this <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-07-24-wilson-neighbor_x.htm">op-ed</a> from the Wilson’s lawyer.  Turns out he didn’t become <em>their</em> lawyer until one day, as their <strong>neighbor</strong>, he read an op-ed by one Robert Novak, informing him that his neighbor was really a CIA agent.
Just another face to the impact that Scooter and Karl had with their little game.  How anyone can continue to defend them is beyond me.</p>

            <p>Who told Wolf Blitzer that he was a hard hitting journalist?  His interview this afternoon of Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez was full of weighted questions with zero, nada, zilch follow-up.  On the surface, the question seemed legitimate, however, after the canned response (obviously the questions had been vetted), <em>Wolf</em> simply took Gonzalez’s answer and moved on to the next lolipop question.  At least Russert and Mathews push a little further with the question before moving on.  A good read on the subject, IMO, is Katrina Vanden Huevel’s <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?bid=7&amp;pid=4659">comments</a> on Bob Costas, of all people, filling in for another softy, Larry King.  It makes me laugh when righties call CNN a “left-wing media organization”.  What does that make Katrina and her magazine <em>The Nation</em>?  A revolutionary media organization?</p>

            <p>So CNN has this feature in their afternoon politics show, where these two chicks are surfin’ the web for blogs and what’s being discussed about the current events.  So I realize all they are really doing is searching Technorati for keywords. And though I know Technorati pulls categories as tags, a politics rant may not show up in a search about Tom DeLay.  Thus, I installed a tag generator for the site (via a <a href="http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-keywords">WordPress plugin, Jerome’s keywords</a>) so that I can start adding tags to my posts, and possibly get some hotty on CNN to read my post on air.  Is that not the most geeky thing to strive for?</p>

            <p>So I’m sitting here working, listening to CNN in the background, and the President is doing a press conference with the Prime Minister of Australia, and they open the floor to questions.  Obviously, the two pressing issues that arise are the Supreme Court and the “Leak”.  First question is about the Supreme Court, and whether or not it’s important to name a woman to replace O’Connor.  So, he stumbles around, as usual, and then says this doozy, “ I want to be known as the kind of person who does what he says he’s going to do…“<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050719.html">Link to transcript of press conference</a>.
Now, concerning the “Leak”, didn’t he say that if anyone that was involved worked in  the White House, they’d be fired? And hasn’t he basically recanted that statement in the last few days? So, Mr. President, which is it going to be, a “person who does what he says he’s going to do”, or a person who does what he’s told to?</p>
