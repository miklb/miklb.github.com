Without getting into the whys and hows this statement came about, I find it very simple, yet poignant and applicable to many of life's situations.
<blockquote>
We're still learning to walk, and we're going to trip every now and then and sometimes when we run, we're going to fall on our faces. But as long as we get up, try again, and learn something from the experience, in the end, skinned knees and all, it'll be worth it.
