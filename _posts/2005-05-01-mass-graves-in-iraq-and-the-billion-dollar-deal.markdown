So I've been reading the blog <a href="http://www.roadstoiraq.com/"> Baghdad Dweller</a> and the discussion of the mass graves of Kurds.  Which reminded me of how these graves were one of the foundations of the Bush administration of defending it's toppling of the Saddam regime, once <i>weapons of mass destruction</i> were not found.  Sure, its a sad story, and sure, it is a horrendous act.  However, I was also reminded of how the first Bush administration under the leadership of Howard Baker ignored the knowledge of such acts (as outlined in this <a href="http://foia.state.gov/documents/foiadocs/2715.PDF">declassified document -note, PDF file</a>) pushed through a billion dollars worth of aid for Iraq.  The entire ugly truth is outline <a href="http://nsarchive.chadwyck.com/igessayx.htm">here.</a>
