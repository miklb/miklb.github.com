    <meta name="description" content="I’ve long been a customer and ardent “word-of-mouth” supporter of Metro PCS.  Heck, they even added web browsing (albeit a handcuffed version).  However, after my experience with their customer support today, I can not advocate the company, or will no longer be a customer.  I’ve always wondered if their business model was really aimed at low-income people looking for a quick and easy cell phone option, and now I think that’s the case.  A genuine desire to hang onto long time customers certainly wasn’t in my experience today.Long story short, I’m a procrastinator.  I simply wait until the last minute to pay bills.

Nothing uncommon on my end, I’ve done it routinely since I got the service.  However, last night, I couldn’t process the online payment gateway.  Tried again today, still no luck, so I called their payment service customer support.  First agent said turn off pop-up blockers.  I explained I’ve never had that issue before, but humored them and tried.  No luck.  I call back, this time I’m asked, “are you using FireFox Mozilla?”  “Yes”, I replied. Nut shell- they stopped supporting Mozilla.  No explanation, just, “use IE.”" />

              <p>I’ve long been a customer and ardent “word-of-mouth” supporter of Metro PCS.  Heck, they even added web browsing (albeit a handcuffed version).  However, after my experience with their customer support today, I can not advocate the company, or will no longer be a customer.

Long story short, I’m a procrastinator.  I simply wait until the last minute to pay bills.  Certainly I’m working on fixing that defect, see my post about GTD and a desire to at least <em>know</em> that a bill is due.  So last night I tried paying my bill, the last day.  Nothing uncommon on my end, I’ve done it routinely since I got the service.  However, last night, I couldn’t process the online payment gateway.  Tried again today, still no luck, so I called their payment service customer support.  First agent said turn off pop-up blockers.  I explained I’ve never had that issue before, but humored them and tried.  No luck.  I call back, this time I’m asked, “are you using FireFox Mozilla?”  “Yes”, I replied. Nut shell- they stopped supporting Mozilla.  No explanation, just, “use IE.”</p>
              <p><em>I started this some time ago, and it’s been sitting as a draft, so I figured I’d wrap it up as I just mentioned Flickr and mobblogging</em>
                After I let the account lapse, I procrastinated some more, not signing up with another service, to the point I figured I’d go ahead and keep Metro PCS for a little longer.  I paid my bill, (approx a month later) and service was back on.  The next morning, I get a text message saying I need to pay another $60.  So I try calling them to find out what was going on.  I probably spent an hour just finding a phone number where I could speak with a human being.  I finally had to call an authorized reseller in St. Petersburg (I live in Tampa) to get a number.  They informed me that though I don’t have a contract, their policy is that you pay for the month of service, even if the phone wasn’t in use.  I said that was unacceptable, and wanted a refund.  That I did get.  But never in the whole process did anyone acknowledge that the whole issue arose from their poor web interface, and offer to simply waive a month, or any reconnect fees to keep me as a customer.</p>
              <p>Some irony to that is that when ever I would end a conversation with a rep, they would say “we value your business here at Metro PCS”.  Did they really?  I think not.  I highly suggest looking at other alternatives to their service, as I do not think they care about long term customers, and are more in the business of short term, “turn and burn” clientele.</p>
