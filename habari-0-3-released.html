      <p>After roughly 3 months, the new developer release of <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a> is now available for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/habari/downloads/list">download</a>.  I just saw the 0.2 release was downloaded nearly 11,000 times, which I personally think is great, I’d hope to see double that for the .3 release.</p>

<p>This release has many <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Releases/0.3">bug fixes and features added</a>, for both the coder and user.  Personally, I contributed a fair amount of work on documentation, including my continued work on the manual, as well as getting my coding hands dirty a bit working on the first steps to overhaul the admin interface.</p>

<p>Participating in this community has been one of the few bright spots in my otherwise gloomy year, and I’d like to personally thank all of those who participate.  I’ve also expanded my “tech” knowledge, specifically in relation to using more of the CLI and subversion.  I actually managed to move a repository the other night from my local machine to a new repository on my Media Temple server that they provide.  I’ve now even ventured into using <a href="http://www.macports.org/">macports</a> to set up my old laptop to be a better mobile development environment, as MAMP for Panther doesn’t support PHP 5.2 (but that’s for a future post).</p>

<p>Suffice to say, I’m looking forward to the Habari community growing, and great things to come.  Even if you aren’t ready to switch blog platforms, I’d highly suggest downloading and checking it out, and by all means, keep abreast of development.  It’s a fun and inviting community, with a lot of excitement for what it’s future holds.</p>

<p>Also stay tuned for a soon to be updated version of <a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi">Mzingi</a>my Habari theme framework, to leverage some of the new features available to themes.</p>
