This past week it was proposed and not shot down in flames that my first foray into a Habari theme, <a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi">mzingi</a> , intended as a simple, image free theme to be used as a foundation for building proper themes, should be included into the core download of <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a>.

I was humbled and honored to say the least, and so from here on out, all development for this project will be maintained by the community.

Thanks to all who've helped, and shared their appreciation for it's intended purpose, and I trust the community will continue to use it for creating full fledged themes.  Feels a little odd, but satisfying at the same time.
