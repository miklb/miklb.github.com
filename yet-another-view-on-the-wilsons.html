      <p>I never read the USA Today, online or else where, but somehow stumbled onto this <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-07-24-wilson-neighbor_x.htm">op-ed</a> from the Wilson’s lawyer.  Turns out he didn’t become <em>their</em> lawyer until one day, as their <strong>neighbor</strong>, he read an op-ed by one Robert Novak, informing him that his neighbor was really a CIA agent.
Just another face to the impact that Scooter and Karl had with their little game.  How anyone can continue to defend them is beyond me.</p>
