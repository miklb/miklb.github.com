              Tunesday: The Gourds

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>Today I bring the first installment of an idea I had, Tunesday.  Get it, Tuesday + tunes = Tunesday?  OK, not the most ingenious idea I’ve ever had, but since getting my iPhone, I’ve been listening to a lot more music since it’s always with me.  And subsequently, I thought it’d be nice to feature some of my favorite bands, as a nice little break for anyone who wanders through, or follows me on Twitter.</p>
            <p>First up in the installment is <a href="http://www.thegourds.com">The Gourds</a>.  One of my all time favorite bands, especially live, I thought it would be appropriate to feature them as they’ve got a new album out, <cite>Haymaker!</cite>.</p>
            <p>The Gourds hail from Austin, TX, and for the casual listener, might characterize them as <em>country</em>, however their sound is definitely more than that, despite the types of instruments they play.  (Ironically enough, I’ve chosen an in store performance of a new track, <cite>Country Love</cite> to feature from YouTube).</p>
            <p>I would simply characterize their sound as “feel good”, albeit with a definite Alt-Country/Americana bend.</p>
            <p>I was first turned onto the Gourds about 10 years ago by my friend Sandy.  Soon there after, I found a copy of their second album, <cite>Stadium Blitzer</cite> in a thrift store of all places, but it wasn’t until she started working at <a href="http://www.munichrecords.com/">Munich Records</a> and gave me a copy of <cite>Bolsa de Agua</cite> that I really saw the light.  I must have played that album straight through 5 times that first night.<cite>  Hallelujah Shine</cite> is still one of my all time favorite songs.</p>
            <p>Since then, through the beauty of <a href="http://emusic.com">Emusic</a> and Munich Records, I’ve been able to collect all of their albums, and each has been a treat to listen to.  That said, their aforementioned release, <cite>Haymaker!</cite> is their best since <cite>Bolsa de Agua</cite> in my opinion.</p>

            <p>If you’d like a invite to emusic for a trial membership and 50 free downloads (you’ll have to give a CC#, but they don’t charge until after the first month), leave a comment with the email address you’d like it sent to, and I”ll send one your way.  <em>  Shameless confession - you can do a trial membership without the invite from me, but if you were to sign up with emusic after the trial via invite, I’d get a 50 song credit</em>.</p>

              Twitter: Reducing the Noise

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>Just a quick tip to reduce some of the noise in your Twitter stream by only showing @ replies of people you follow.  I was a little surprised more people didn’t know this was a <em>feature</em> built into Twitter. However after speaking to a couple of people at the <a href="http://miklb.com/tampa-mosi-tweetup">Tampa TweetUp</a> who use Twitter professionally and weren’t aware of the setting, I thought it might be worth detailing.</p>
            <p>The basic premise is that you only show @replies from people you are following to people you following.  This isn’t a per user setting unfortunately, however, it does reduce the noise, especially for those prolific Twitters with a lot of followers they are constantly responding to.  99 times out of 100, the response is of a personal nature or has no context, so its just a distraction and noise.</p>
            <p>This setting removes those, and <strong>only</strong> shows @replies to people whom you both follow.</p>
            <p>To change the default setting:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>from the home page, click <em>settings</em></li>
              <li>From <em>settings</em>, click <em>notices</em></li>
              <li>for @ replies dropdown, chose <em>Show me</em> <strong>@ replies to the people I'm following</strong></li>
              <li>Save your new setting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note you can turn off all @replies in this setting as well if you have no interest in messages between two users at all, however, I’ve found that this setting is the best of both worlds, in that at least there’s some context to what a response is about and generally makes sense.  No more @so-and-so, LOL!!!</p>
            <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/twitter_noise.jpg" /></p>
            <p>I’ve recently blogged about <a href="http://miklb.com/cleaning-my-online-house">reducing noise in my online life</a>, and certainly this has helped immensely.  There are several people who I follow that have a broad network and use Twitter as a much more social application, but also occasionally link to interesting tidbits that I’ve found useful.  If it were not for this feature, I’d long ago stopped following them.  Now for there to be a temporary way to <em>mute</em> someone, for instance when they are live Twittering an event you have no interest in…</p>

              Tampa MOSI TweetUp

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>I’m very excited to be attending the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampabloggers/">Tampa TweetUp</a> this Saturday night (1/17/09) at the <a href="http://mosi.org/">Tampa Museum of Science and Industry</a>.  Billed as an unstructured evening for &lt;blockquote&gt;…other local Tweeple who enjoy Twitter, blogging, and all that is social media for an evening of drinks and great conversation. Enjoy a night out of the office or home, Away from your computer, to dork out with others who share similar passions of social networking and have a few drinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
            <p>Not only is this a chance to socialize in person, MOSI is opening up the top of the IMAX dome, giving us an “exclusive 8-story high, 360 degree view of Tampa” (hopefully I’ll be able to get a few good pics), the museum will be introducing their <strong>Virtual Ambassador Program</strong>.  From what I gather of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampabloggers/calendar/9377661/">details of the event</a>, MOSI is developing a viral marketing program by giving bloggers and social media persons some <em>swag</em>, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One year free membership to the museum</li>
              <li>Free ticket to every IMAX film opening from January - June 2009 (excluding special engagements)</li>
              <li>Free ticket to Body Worlds 3 and the Story of the Heart opening January 22, 2009 - The Original Exhibit of Real Human Bodies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>in exchange for a “6 month commitment in helping raise community awareness online about the museum, Body Worlds exhibit, IMAX, and other MOSI offerings”.  I have every intention in participating in the program, as I’d certainly enjoy attending events and exhibits and then blogging/Twittering about them afterward.</p>
            <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/tweetup.jpg" alt="tweetup!" class="left" />In regards to the TweetUp itself, ever since attending <a href="http://www.barcamporlando.org/">BarCamp Orlando</a>, I’ve wanted to connect with local bloggers and web geeks like myself.  To that end, I’ve failed, as scheduling conflicts prevented me from attending <a href="http://barcamptampabay.com/">BarCamp Tampa</a>, as well as a few local blogger meetups.  However, I swore to myself that this year I would make a concerted effort to be available for these events, as well as actively help foster more of them.  I read with envy tweets from people in places like Philadelphia and Orlando who are connecting in real life with other bloggers and developers. I don’t want to wait until I’m in a <a href="http://blogorlando.com/">different city</a> to meet and connect with <a href="http://www.sarahintampa.com/">folks who live down the road</a>.</p>
            <p>Though I don’t consider myself a big “social networker”, I do <a href="http://miklb.com/why-twitter-is-just-em-cool-em">love me some Twitter</a>, and certainly understand their place in today’s web.  I am actually taking my first steps in embracing a broader view of social networking by integrating some of the features available in <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a> into a site I’m developing for a client.  I’ve got a long way to go, but it’s certainly been an enlightening process, and has undeniably changed my attitude towards sites like Facebook in that just because I personally do not participate in a particular network, it doesn’t mean the network has no value.  That said, I don’t think I will ever say the same thing about MySpace.</p>

            <p>Little did I know that I needed to create a separate feed for comments at Feedburner for it to actually work with the Feedburner plugin for Habari.  So if for some reason you wanted to subscribe to site wide comments vs a single post, it’s now working.  I’ve also added recent comments to the sidebar, complete with a spiffy excerpt of the comment.  Thanks to whomever created the summarize function, it only took a PHP n00b like myself a couple of minutes to figure out how to have a <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Recent_Comments">separate comment content excerpt in Habari</a>.</p>

            <p>Finally made it out of the house after a week of being holed up sick, and stopped off to get a case for the iPhone.  First stop was the Apple store, only to be terribly disappointed with the selection.  I did however pick up some <a href="http://www.powersupportusa.com/products/iphone3G_antiglare.php">anti-glare film</a>, which as advertised “provides traction for improved responsiveness”.  I was worried about bubbles, but it applied just fine, with only one small bubble, however the anti-glare totally hides it when the phone is on.  From there, I hit Best Buy and grabbed an inexpensive, utilitarian <a href="http://rocketfishproducts.com/pc-110-7-rocketfish-silicone-case-for-apple-iphone.aspx">silicone case</a>.  It’s quite sufficient for now, at least until I get a dock, not sure it would fit in one, though it’s a fairly thin sleeve.  I’d highly recommend the anti-glare film to any iPhone user.</p>
