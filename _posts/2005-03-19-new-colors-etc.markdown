Well, it took a lot of time searching, (to no avail), and a few posts over at Wordpress, but ultimately it was my own banging of my head to realize the drop shadow was my problem.  anyway, I've changed up the page colors, and now I want to do a new header img, as the img just doesn't work with the new color scheme (not that that is written in stone.).  This is just a blast though, and I can't wait to do more of it.
