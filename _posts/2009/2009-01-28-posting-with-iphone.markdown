Holy cow, I can even post from the Flickr silo!

This kinds blows my mind. Certainly not a primary mode of blogging, but to be able to take a photo with the camera, upload to Flickr, then write a blog post is kinda amazing.

<em>Edit (not via iPhone)</em> To be clear, my amazement isn't in the iPhone, rather, in the quality of design and code of Habari that it just <strong>works</strong>, even in the mobile Safari browser.
