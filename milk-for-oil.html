    <meta name="description" content="Reuters.comOK, so Big Oil said they didn’t need the subsidy, so Congress, trying to save some money here and there figured, hey, we’ll cut the subsidy then.  Smart think guys.  But then this comes along.  Hastert, playing politics, pushes to extend an expired subsidy for dairy farmers.  Granted, an International dairy board is against the subsidy, and there’s got to be something better to do than hand money over to dairy farmers ‘cause they can’t sell their milk, but, hey, when a Republican Congressman is running for Governor of Wisconsin, and Wisconsin was a “battle ground” state, it makes perfect sense.  According to this fact sheet, The MILC (get it, milk)program is about giving milk producers money if the price drops too low.  Why then, can a Republican government that argues about free trade, and capitalism, support such a program.  Because it’s our food supply??  Not mine, I don’t drink milk.  Will they start subsidizing organic produce?  I’d much rather do that, to lower the cost to me, than give a billion dollars to commercial milk farmers." />
