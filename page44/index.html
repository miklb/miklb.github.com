        <p>While I’m in a blogging flurry, I figured I’d go ahead and share my newest “blank theme”.  I do quite a bit of WP work, either converting open source designs, modifying existing site’s design to a WP theme, or custom work, and often have the use for a framework to start.  For the past couple of years, I’ve been using my popular <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/my-site/blank-wordpress-theme/">Blank Theme</a>, but more and more, I’ve found the markup not to my liking, and as it’s based on Kubrick, a bit outdated code wise.  So I’ve cooked up a blank theme from scratch, using much more (hopefully) semantic markup, and a much more streamlined framework.  This version currently only has an index, header, footer, sidebar (as an unordered list, which <em>should</em> be widget ready, though I would need to add a function.php file.  It also includes a bit of code handy for recent posts), single post, and page template.  I also am using <a href="http://www.christianmontoya.com/2006/10/15/full-featured-commentsphp-template-for-wordpress/">Christian Montoya’s comment template</a> instead of Kubricks.  I hopefully covered all the elements in the templates in the style sheet, as well as have a few basic global elements set.</p>

<p>Remember, this is a <strong>blank theme.  It is completely unstyled, and is meant as a framework in which to customize a theme</strong>.  Also, this is meant for WP &gt;= 2.1.x, as it uses several new template tags.</p>

<p><strong>Update:  Download link fixed. (damn typos)</strong></p>

<p>You can download the <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blankv2beta.zip">Blank Theme v2 beta</a>.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any and all feed back, both for missing elements, and suggestions for additions.</p>

        <p><img class="left" src="http://www.miklb.com/user/files/zippy_01.jpg" alt="zippy" />Lately I’ve spent a fair amount of time on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/habari/">Habari’s </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> channel, mostly because some really smart people are there, and because <a href="http://wooga.drbacchus.com/">Dr Bacchus</a> has a bot on the channel that if you type “yow”, will randomly quote Zippy the Pinhead.  I first discovered Zippy while living in Denver in the early 90’s.  it was a daily comic in the (<strong>I think</strong>)<em>Rocky Mountain News</em>.  Not long after, being a casual fan of alt-comics, I discovered <a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/">Fantagraphics</a>, and then soon after they published several collections of Zippy comics.  I still own the first 3 issues of the collection somehow (the time soon after moving back from Colorado can be a bit hazy, to say the least).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.miklb.com/user/files/zippy_02.jpg" alt="zippy" />I don’t even begin to consider myself a Zippy fanatic, and have barely kept up with the comic since those days, but I can’t help but <strong>l</strong>augh <strong>o</strong>ut <strong>l</strong>oud when ever I type those three letters on IRC.  No matter how bored, frustrated, or confused I might be with my situation at hand, good ol’ mzuri and his Zippy quotes pick me up, and break the ice just enough to keep going.  So the next time you are having a rough time just think of your Zippy, and quotes like:</p>
<blockquote>"Wouldn't it be great, Zip, if th' spirit of Halloween could last all year long?"

"Yow! A never ending orgy of apple-bobbing and miniature mars bars!"</blockquote>

        <p>So if anyone has an “old school” flickr account, they too received an email a while back saying that as of March 15th, they needed to merge with a yahoo id.  I had a yahoo id, which I never really use.  And like most people, they are probably a bit attached to their online identities.  Obviously, I use miklb where ever I can.  I was a bit upset at the prospect of losing my flickr account of /miklb.  Granted, the yahoo account I have is miklb.online, but somehow that just isn’t what I wanted.  So I procrastinated in making the switch.  Finally, today, I went about looking into it, as I didn’t want to get locked out of my moblog images.  (Currently, I do not have a cell service with a camera phone, but not all of those images are still on my old phone, anyway…) I went to the flickr account, and saw the “merge” accounts option.  I went to merge miklb with yahoo id miklb.online.  No go.  miklb.online was already associated with flickr.  Ugh.  When did I do that?</p>

<p>So looking at that account, I hadn’t actually uploaded any images, so I saw I could delete the flickr account for that ID.  I didn’t know if I could then re-associate it, but what the heck, I figured I’d give it a shot.  I deleted the yahoo id from flickr, and tried again to merge, still thinking I’d become miklb.online.  In the meantime, I found a flickr export app for the Mac, <a href="http://sunkencity.org/flickrbackup/">Flickrbackup</a>, grabbed my images just in case, and then made the association between the old school account and the yahoo id.  All went smooth, and to my surprise, I get to keep the miklb account, I simply now log in with the yahoo id.  Excellent.  Perhaps this will move me to use flickr a bit more, I know I’d love to get a friend of mine to use it, but he’s a myspacer, and I don’t even know what he’s using to host his images.  (Goody Goody, I’ll even set you up with a blog if you make the switch from myspace).
So, long story short, it was far less painful to make the switch, and if you haven’t done so, fret not, if you have to be pumpkinpatch6969 instead of your favorite handle, you’ll not loose your flickr name.</p>

        No Longer a Champion of Metro PCS

    <time datetime="2007-03-12T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">12 Mar 2007</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p>I’ve long been a customer and ardent “word-of-mouth” supporter of Metro PCS.  Heck, they even added web browsing (albeit a handcuffed version).  However, after my experience with their customer support today, I can not advocate the company, or will no longer be a customer.  I’ve always wondered if their business model was really aimed at low-income people looking for a quick and easy cell phone option, and now I think that’s the case.  A genuine desire to hang onto long time customers certainly wasn’t in my experience today.
Long story short, I’m a procrastinator.  I simply wait until the last minute to pay bills.  Certainly I’m working on fixing that defect, see my post about GTD and a desire to at least <em>know</em> that a bill is due.  So last night I tried paying my bill, the last day.  Nothing uncommon on my end, I’ve done it routinely since I got the service.  However, last night, I couldn’t process the online payment gateway.  Tried again today, still no luck, so I called their payment service customer support.  First agent said turn off pop-up blockers.  I explained I’ve never had that issue before, but humored them and tried.  No luck.  I call back, this time I’m asked, “are you using FireFox Mozilla?”  “Yes”, I replied. Nut shell- they stopped supporting Mozilla.  No explanation, just, “use IE.”</p>

<p><em>I started this some time ago, and it’s been sitting as a draft, so I figured I’d wrap it up as I just mentioned Flickr and mobblogging</em> 
After I let the account lapse, I procrastinated some more, not signing up with another service, to the point I figured I’d go ahead and keep Metro PCS for a little longer.  I paid my bill, (approx a month later) and service was back on.  The next morning, I get a text message saying I need to pay another $60.  So I try calling them to find out what was going on.  I probably spent an hour just finding a phone number where I could speak with a human being.  I finally had to call an authorized reseller in St. Petersburg (I live in Tampa) to get a number.  They informed me that though I don’t have a contract, their policy is that you pay for the month of service, even if the phone wasn’t in use.  I said that was unacceptable, and wanted a refund.  That I did get.  But never in the whole process did anyone acknowledge that the whole issue arose from their poor web interface, and offer to simply waive a month, or any reconnect fees to keep me as a customer.</p>

<p>Some irony to that is that when ever I would end a conversation with a rep, they would say “we value your business here at Metro PCS”.  Did they really?  I think not.  I highly suggest looking at other alternatives to their service, as I do not think they care about long term customers, and are more in the business of short term, “turn and burn” clientele.</p>

        Following Up on GTD

    <div class="e-content">
        <p>Well, two months into the year, and I’m still struggling with a good GTD system.  I am using Actiontastic still, but for work, I’m using <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com">Fresh Books</a> to time track and invoice clients.  (For those that care, I’ve gone full time into web work.  Mostly WordPress, but I’ve done a fair amount of non-WP work.  My working site is <a href="http://www.bishopblogworks.com">Bishop Blog Works</a>. Please understand the design is in flux).</p>

<p>Fresh Books is great, but I can’t get my clients to use the ticket system.  Email is still their method of choice for notifying me of needed changes, for both active projects, and site tweaks.  Fresh Books says they will have an email to ticket system, but if that doesn’t materialize sooner than later, I may have to look at another option.  In the meantime, I try to take the email, add it to iCal as a todo using <a hfref="http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html">Mailtags</a>, then sync iCal with Actiontastic, and THEN add those as tickets/tasks in Fresh Books.</p>

<p>Not working out so well.</p>

<p>On a positive note, I’ve streamlined the home office, clearing out a lot of clutter, which I believe makes it easier to get started in the morning and stay focused.</p>

<p>If anyone has a suggestion for converting emails to a time tracking system, I’d love to hear about it.  I have started looking at <a href="http://kingdesign.net/tasks/">Alex King’s Tracks </a>, as it has an email to task ability, but the demo doesn’t seem to allow for that.  It requires running a cron job on your server, and since Alex is setting the demo up on his, I don’t see a way to test that feature.  If it works, I could have clients send an email that is picked up by Tasks, and then time track straight from that.  But then I’m back to either having two “apps” for time tracking/invoicing.  Hopefully Fresh Books will roll out that feature soon, and I’ll be good to go.  I then simply forward a copy of the ticket to Mail.app, add it to Actiontastic, and it’s automatically added to a ticket.  Or at least that’s how I’d draw it up on paper.</p>
