<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002290445_salmon27m.html">The Seattle Times</a>While we all argue whether or not the Bush admin's appointees should get an "up or down vote", Judge Redden is shutting out the Bush plan to allow 

<blockquote>51 percent of the young spring chinook to die while migrating downstream from the Snake River, and up to 92 percent of the young fall chinook migrating down the river.
</blockquote>
The fall chinook are considered a threatened species, which means there is a likelyhood of extinction in the future.  Well, <strong>if you let 92% of the young die every year, you certainly are going to get to the endangered list, real fast!!</strong>
The real question is are the people of the area willing to pay more for power, otherwise, no matter what a judge rules, money will be the determining factor.  I for one trust that the people of pacific northwest will do the right thing.
