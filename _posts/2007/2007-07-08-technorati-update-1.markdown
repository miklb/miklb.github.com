It seems that Technorati finally was able to index the site, as well as fix the issue with the site regarding new claims for sites not supported with the their quick claim.  Not sure why I was actually waiting for the claim before blogging more here, but it worked out, as I was out with a medical issue the past few weeks, so timing is everything.  I really look forward to blogging, and now I have no excuses.

Special thanks to <a href="http://h0bbel.p0ggel.org/2007/06/27/technorati-claim-or-blame/">Christian(aka h0bbel)</a> for expressing a similar concern about Technorati's handling of this situation.
