How bloody cool is this: <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/stamps/">ZazzleStamps</a> your own image on a real, licensed stamp.  I think 20 stamps is around $16, and the more you buy, the cheaper they get.  And if you've got a <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> account, then you can easily choose an image from there for the stamp.
