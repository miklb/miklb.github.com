I have to say, his blogging has made it infectious to be a Mav’s fan for the finals.

I also came across Mark Cuban’s blog while checking out some feeds while investigating over at Share Your OPML as the playoffs started.

Mark Cuban, blogger and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is blogging the NBA finals.  I have to say, his blogging has made it infectious to be a Mav’s fan for the finals.  I’m not really a basketball fan, but have a few friends who’ve been watching the playoffs, so I’ve followed along.  I also came across Mark Cuban’s blog while checking out some feeds while investigating over at <a href="http://share.opml.org">Share Your OPML</a> as the playoffs started.  So I’ve been following his blogs while keeping an eye to the playoffs.  It’s fun to see things transpire as they have.</p>
