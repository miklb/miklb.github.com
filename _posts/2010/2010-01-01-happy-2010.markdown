Perhaps I'm just a sucker for a reason to say things are going to change, but this little <a href="http://moninavelarde.com/newyears/">flash site to create your 2010 resolution</a> spun one my way that dove tails into the <a href="http://miklb.com/procrastinating-to-get-things-done">last post I made on this site</a>.

Speaking of the site, to ring in the new year I finally updated Habari, as it was oh, 300+ revisions behind latest commit.  Aside from having to upgrade a bunch of plugins from before the XML file as added and the info function removed, it went off without a hitch.  I also had to swap out a little code in the tweet template, but otherwise, for a script running off of trunk that hadn't been svn upped since May, it was pretty damn painless, and a testimony to how stable it really is.

I do have some ideas for my <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking site</a>, inspired by <a href="http://h0bbel.p0ggel.org/">Christian</a> and his 365 days of photos in '09. <em><strong>Congrats again for seeing it all the way through!</strong></em>

Perhaps not a dish a day, but maybe one new thing from scratch a week with a post would be a good and realistic goal.

Anyway, may MMX be a shining path of peace and enlightenment paved with prosperity aâ€¦I mean, may it fucking suck less than 2009 did, and hopefully we'll get through it a little less scarred than the last.

Special thanks to <a href="http://mikelietz.com/whine">Mike Lietz</a> for talking me down from the ledge I was on after I started the upgrade, and especially for showing me the handy svn wildcard command.  Most of the plugins I had were already trunk version from the Habari-Extra's repository, but I thought I was going to have to cd into each one and svn up, he showed me I could do <pre class="prettyprint">svn up user/plugins/*</pre> and it would step through the directories and svn them up. Handy!  

I'd also like to take a second to thank <a href="http://shardsofconsciousness.com/">Rick Cockrum</a> for keeping the ball moving this past summer/fall on the development side of things, I'm really looking forward to digging into the new taxonomy system, especially as I build out the cooking site.
