<a href="http://www.votejan.com/">Jan Schneider for Congress</a>Just a note to any readers in  Congressional district 13, to support Jan Schneider in her attempt to take the seat vacated by Katherine Harris.  I've gotten several emails pushing for her support, and come across a couple of blog posts as well, so I took a minute to check out her credentials.  Not your soccer mom got bored, or super rich white girl with nothing better to do type of candidate.  It's also my understanding that a recent Democrat convert is being supported by the DNC.  I hope that's not the case, and all because one may have a few more dollars than the other.  Shame shame.

I'd love to know more about this one, so if you have any details, do share.
