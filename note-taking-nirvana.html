I’m easily caught up in chasing the productivity pr0n, looking for the perfect system (hell,  I gues by writing this post, I’m still doing that).  At first glance however, with the discovery of my most recent set of tools, I believe I’ve found the most streamlined, cohesive solution yet.</p>
              <p>My most recent excursion in a single note taking solution was EverNote.  Certainly versatile, perhaps too so, and it never felt like the right fit.  It was just too <em>something</em>.  I wanted a no frills solution that I could easily access my notes from my desktop, laptop and on the go (currently using an iPhone).  Certainly EverNote fits that bill, but again, too cumbersome and too busy.</p>
              <p>A little while ago, I stumbled on a Habari plugin, <a href=" http://lab.morgante.net/simplynoted">SimplyNoted</a>, which interfaced with an iPhone app <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">SimpleNote</a>.  Quite an elegant little app/plugin, I could take notes on my phone and be able to pull them up in a Habari <a href="http://asymptomatic.net/2008/01/15/2688/this-is-how-media-should-be-done-habari-style">Silo</a>, and turn them into a blog post, etc.  Nice, but my iPhone isn’t the only place I take notes or want to do a brain dump.  So it’s lingered on the second page of my phone, starring at me, taunting me to use it.  Then the other day, the always with a great idea Merlin Mann, resurrecting his invaluable 43folders website, <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/02/01/notational-velocity-now-syncs-simplenote">posted a screenshot  and short post about his workflow</a>.</p>
              <p>Wait, did I just read about something syncing with SimpleNote?  Sure enough, Merlin was espousing the virtues of an app he’d been using, and how it now syncs with SimpleNote.  <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> is a no frills, desktop application (is there a mobile, I didn’t look) that snycs with SimpleNote, quietly saving behind the scenes,with plenty of keyboard shortcuts but no fluff.  It gets out of the way and makes it easy to just jot notes, brain dump, or I’m sure in the hands of someone like Merlin, far, far more.  But for this simple guy, it was the missing link to being able to have an app on my Macs that did all the things that SimpleNote could do.</p>
              <p>So far in two days of using it, it’s been more <strong>usable</strong> than any other system I’ve tried.  I was able to bang out some thoughts before bed on my laptop, both gather links for this post as well as some outlined thoughts (yeah, this was actually thought out), as well as some ideas for some work I had to do today.  I was able to grab those notes when I hit the desktop this morning without doing anything, add to them, and then pick them back up on the laptop later in the day to finish up the writing I needed to do for my new job.  After dinner, I was able to then login to the admin of the blog, start a new post, open the SimplyNoted silo, and bang, all of my links and notes were there to write a post.  I can’t count how many events I’ve been to the past year that I took notes at either in EverNote or with TiddlyWiki, but never got around to copying them over to writing a post.  I look forward to this being the missing link between thinking about blogging, and blogging.  Time will tell.</p>
