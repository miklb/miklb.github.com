                <p>While I’m in a blogging flurry, I figured I’d go ahead and share my newest “blank theme”.  I do quite a bit of WP work, either converting open source designs, modifying existing site’s design to a WP theme, or custom work, and often have the use for a framework to start.  For the past couple of years, I’ve been using my popular <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/my-site/blank-wordpress-theme/">Blank Theme</a>, but more and more, I’ve found the markup not to my liking, and as it’s based on Kubrick, a bit outdated code wise.  So I’ve cooked up a blank theme from scratch, using much more (hopefully) semantic markup, and a much more streamlined framework.  This version currently only has an index, header, footer, sidebar (as an unordered list, which <em>should</em> be widget ready, though I would need to add a function.php file.  It also includes a bit of code handy for recent posts), single post, and page template.  I also am using <a href="http://www.christianmontoya.com/2006/10/15/full-featured-commentsphp-template-for-wordpress/">Christian Montoya’s comment template</a> instead of Kubricks.  I hopefully covered all the elements in the templates in the style sheet, as well as have a few basic global elements set.</p>
                <p>Remember, this is a <strong>blank theme.  It is completely unstyled, and is meant as a framework in which to customize a theme</strong>.  Also, this is meant for WP &gt;= 2.1.x, as it uses several new template tags.</p>
                <p><strong>Update:  Download link fixed. (damn typos)</strong></p>
                <p>You can download the <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blankv2beta.zip">Blank Theme v2 beta</a>.</p>
                <p>I would appreciate any and all feed back, both for missing elements, and suggestions for additions.</p>

                <p><img class="left" src="http://www.miklb.com/user/files/zippy_01.jpg" alt="zippy" />Lately I’ve spent a fair amount of time on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/habari/">Habari’s </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> channel, mostly because some really smart people are there, and because <a href="http://wooga.drbacchus.com/">Dr Bacchus</a> has a bot on the channel that if you type “yow”, will randomly quote Zippy the Pinhead.  I first discovered Zippy while living in Denver in the early 90’s.  it was a daily comic in the (<strong>I think</strong>)<em>Rocky Mountain News</em>.  Not long after, being a casual fan of alt-comics, I discovered <a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/">Fantagraphics</a>, and then soon after they published several collections of Zippy comics.  I still own the first 3 issues of the collection somehow (the time soon after moving back from Colorado can be a bit hazy, to say the least).</p>
                <p><img class="right" src="http://www.miklb.com/user/files/zippy_02.jpg" alt="zippy" />I don’t even begin to consider myself a Zippy fanatic, and have barely kept up with the comic since those days, but I can’t help but <strong>l</strong>augh <strong>o</strong>ut <strong>l</strong>oud when ever I type those three letters on IRC.  No matter how bored, frustrated, or confused I might be with my situation at hand, good ol’ mzuri and his Zippy quotes pick me up, and break the ice just enough to keep going.  So the next time you are having a rough time just think of your Zippy, and quotes like:</p>
                <blockquote>"Wouldn't it be great, Zip, if th' spirit of Halloween could last all year long?"

"Yow! A never ending orgy of apple-bobbing and miniature mars bars!"</blockquote>

                <p>So if anyone has an “old school” flickr account, they too received an email a while back saying that as of March 15th, they needed to merge with a yahoo id.  I had a yahoo id, which I never really use.  And like most people, they are probably a bit attached to their online identities.  Obviously, I use miklb where ever I can.  I was a bit upset at the prospect of losing my flickr account of /miklb.  Granted, the yahoo account I have is miklb.online, but somehow that just isn’t what I wanted.  So I procrastinated in making the switch.  Finally, today, I went about looking into it, as I didn’t want to get locked out of my moblog images.  (Currently, I do not have a cell service with a camera phone, but not all of those images are still on my old phone, anyway…) I went to the flickr account, and saw the “merge” accounts option.  I went to merge miklb with yahoo id miklb.online.  No go.  miklb.online was already associated with flickr.  Ugh.  When did I do that?</p>
                <p>So looking at that account, I hadn’t actually uploaded any images, so I saw I could delete the flickr account for that ID.  I didn’t know if I could then re-associate it, but what the heck, I figured I’d give it a shot.  I deleted the yahoo id from flickr, and tried again to merge, still thinking I’d become miklb.online.  In the meantime, I found a flickr export app for the Mac, <a href="http://sunkencity.org/flickrbackup/">Flickrbackup</a>, grabbed my images just in case, and then made the association between the old school account and the yahoo id.  All went smooth, and to my surprise, I get to keep the miklb account, I simply now log in with the yahoo id.  Excellent.  Perhaps this will move me to use flickr a bit more, I know I’d love to get a friend of mine to use it, but he’s a myspacer, and I don’t even know what he’s using to host his images.  (Goody Goody, I’ll even set you up with a blog if you make the switch from myspace).
So, long story short, it was far less painful to make the switch, and if you haven’t done so, fret not, if you have to be pumpkinpatch6969 instead of your favorite handle, you’ll not loose your flickr name.</p>
