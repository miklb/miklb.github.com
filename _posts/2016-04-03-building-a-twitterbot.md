summary: In which I outline my desire to learn some python & build a Twitterbot.
---
 I had an interest to learn the programming language python for quite some time. I've played around with it a little using [Pythonista](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista/id528579881?at=10lKmy) in iOS to [build a fishing log](https://miklb.com/use-pythonista-to-get-weather-of-current-location-into-drafts-app), but otherwise have only done some cursory reading. Since I do best learning by doing, I needed an idea to **use** python. I've seen some interesting Twitterbots built with it, [@pomological](https://twitter.com/pomological) being my recent favorite, but wasn't sure what to build. Ultimately, the idea came to me to build a bot that retrieves an image from Flickr and builds a color scheme from that and post the scheme and original image. I've done some basic research and found some libraries to connect (you didn't think I was going to write the whole thing from scratch?).

 But I don't just want a any random image, so once I get the bot *working*, I want to be able to try and pull outdoor/landscape images. In a perfect world, I would post 3 images a dayâ€”morning, noon, and night. The morning image would be a sunrise, noon/daytime image a normal image and, you guessed it, the night/evening image would be a sunset.

 I figured I needed a name for the Twitterbot, not only to make sure something would be available, but since I would need API keys, that has been my first tangible step to create the bot. Thus, @Flickolorbot has been officially conceived.

 Stay tuned for more adventures.
