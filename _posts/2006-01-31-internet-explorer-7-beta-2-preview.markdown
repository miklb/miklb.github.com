<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/default.mspx">Internet Explorer 7: Beta 2 Preview</a>I never thought I'd herald the release of an IE product, and after testing it I may not be so interested, but if you've ever sat up until 5am trying to hack IE bugs in a completely valid site while your client in California keeps saying, "In IE...", then the prospects of some of those bugs being gone is well, worth the annoucement.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/29/445242.aspx">Annouced last July on the developer's blog</a>, these bugs are supposed to be addressed  in beta 2.
<ul>
 <li>Peekaboo bug</li>
    	<li>Guillotine bug</li>
	<li>Duplicate Character bug</li>
<li> Border Chaos</li>
    <li>No Scroll bug</li>
   <li> 3 Pixel Text Jog</li>
   <li> Magic Creeping Text bug</li>
    <li>Bottom Margin bug on Hover</li>
   <li> Losing the ability to highlight text under the top border</li>
   <li> IE/Win Line-height bug</li>
  <li> Double Float Margin Bug</li>
    <li> Quirky Percentages in IE</li>
    <li>Duplicate indent</li>
    <li>Moving viewport scrollbar outside HTML borders</li>
    <li> 1 px border style</li>
    <li>Disappearing List-background</li>
    <li>Fix width:auto</li>
</ul>
And I'll say a bug I spent several hours hacking last night is fixed in beta2.  Good sign (it was a lesser known a:hover background sticking bug, for those who care).

Like I said, maybe a little less cursing now.
