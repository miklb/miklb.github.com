Well, this <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r104:14:./temp/~r104eoBniU:e147755:"> quote </a> is making the rounds of the blog sphere, so I'd b e remiss not to include it here (especially since finding dirt on The Hammer has become my number one hobby).
<blockquote>
The time has come that the American people know exactly what their Representatives are doing here in Washington.

Are they feeding at the public trough, taking lobbyist paid vacations, getting wined and dined by special interest groups? Or are they working hard to represent their constituents?</blockquote>
