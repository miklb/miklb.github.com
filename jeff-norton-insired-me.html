  <div class="e-content">
      <p>I was  a quasi punk teenager when I first traveled to Hyde Park to experience “art”.  Sure, I’d done the Ybor thing, but this was high end stuff as far as I had experienced it.  A live performance of actors was way more than seeing Black Flag do 3 songs then run off stage.  This was <em>School of Night</em>.  I honestly don’t remember the skits, but I do remember Jeff and another actor doing a scene from a Sam Shepard piece (<em> I think </em> it was from <cite>True West</cite>).</p>

<p>As I grew older, I took advantage of the opportunities to experience Jeff’s larger performances with troupes like  <a href="http://www.americanstage.org/">American Stage</a>.   During this time, I was introduced to Jeff through a mutual acquaintance.  He was humble, brooding.  Everything I had pictured an artist to be.  I was jealous.</p>

<p>I thought him an older but kindred spirit, not a celebrity.  He <strong>was</strong> an artist.  I got a glimpse of a genius.  Someone who was so comfortable with his art; perhaps tortured in the fact that he was such a craftsman of his art that he could perform it in a burgh such as Tampa.  He trusted that there were like minded souls who also parked their tent in this god-forsaken mosquito ridden peninsula of peninsulas a genuine art scene would evolve.  I know I cooked food with that same passion.  I regret I didn’t stay true to my own passion…</p>

<p>I for one apologize for being so shortsighted I didn’t realize it sooner–yes, I wanted a dynamic, brilliant local scene. And there is one. Theatre, food, dance… it’s all there.  Maybe not how I envisioned it because I wanted brilliance such as Jeff’s to be national news, and in my youth I lost my vision.</p>

<p>However, in the twilight of my own perspective, and in the sunset of the passing of Jeff Norton, I reflect on that first night in a little corner bistro at Howard and Azeele, and pray that the baton of pure passion and art will continued to be passed.</p>

<p>God speed Jeff Norton, god speed.</p>
