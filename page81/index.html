                <p>Yes, I haven’t blogged in a while, and yes, I’ve been busy cooking for a living again.  However that doesn’t mean I don’t intend to continue blogging, nor do I completely ignore the news.  That said, I was shocked when I heard on the news today that U2 was doing a fundraiser for Rick Santorum.  Then I read over at <a href="http://joetrippi.com">Joe Trippi’s site </a> that ol’ Santorum and the conservative news blogs got the message wrong.&lt;blockquote&gt;Santorum . . . you may want to wipe those eggs off of your face&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And was just starting to think the world was really slipping off its axis. Whew!  Not just yet.</p>

                <p>I was checking my recent referers, and saw that I had several referals from <a href="http://www.seminoleheights.blogspot.com">Seminole Heights Blog</a>, and the discussion of the bay area being “blog capital of Florida”.   I rarely discuss Tampa issues, and funny enough, I just came across an <a href="http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBAWR2F6EE.html">article</a> at tbo.com discussing Tampa officials wanting to ease laws regarding gifts of tickets.  When I read the article, I almost wrote about it then.  But after reading the discussion, I feel I must touch on it. 
                  <!--more-->
                  The article discusses the desire of Iorio and city council members wanting to be allowed to accept tickets that cost more than the $100 that they are currently allowed to accept.  And my question is this, what events are you wanting to go to that cost more than $100?  The article discusses “community events”, but I’m not aware of these events.  If they are fundraisers rather than community events, I would question who is raising the funds, and why exactly do they need the mayor or a city council person there?  Iorio discusses a USF game recently.  Last time I checked, tickets were less than $100 to the game.  Likewise in Dingfelder’s Bucs game issues.  Tickets can cost much less than $100.  Now, in my humble opinion, if these elected officials want to hang out in a luxury box, and eat a catered meal, drink top-shelf cocktails while watching a football game rather than sit in the seats with those who elected them, then they should pay for the difference out of their pocket.  Likewise, if it’s a fundraiser, be it children’s causes or Gasparilla, I’m uncomfortable with event planners being able to bring in the mayor for free, which may be a “selling point” to those wealthy enough to attend.  Smells fishy all ready.</p>

                <p>As some who’ve read here before, you know I’ve looked forward to this day for some time.  The only thing I look forward to more now is the day Tom DeLay is found guilty of at least some of his crimes against this country.  To me, he’s committed treason.  He’s cheated and lied to the American people, and circumvented the law, which thereby prevented the people of Texas from rightly electing their officials.  But this is all fairly main stream news.  What I’ve found more interesting is the mantra the democratic party line is using in the recent criminal charges/investigations…“culture of corruption”.  When election time rolls around in ‘06, expect that phrase to be played out over and over.  I think that will be the real “platform” for unseating the Republicans.  I think it can be used in just about every situation from the appointment of Brown to FEMA to the gerrymandering issues in Texas.</p>

                <p>In case you missed it, Katrina Vanden Hueval and Ann Coulter were part of Larry King’s panel discussing the DeLay indictment. However, the difference is those two were in the studio with King, whereas the others where off-studio cameras.  As usual, Coulter had to try and get the last word, wouldn’t answer King’s questions (I’ll give it to the old softy, he sorta tried to ask the hard questions), and basically came across as her lunatic self.  Vanden Hueval surprised me when she even joined the mantra of “culture of corruption”.  Ultimately, it was a matter of two diametrically opposed political commentators, and nothing new was added.  But at times, it looked like there could be a cat fight.</p>
