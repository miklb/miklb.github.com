Also, if you notice something awry, please leave a comment.

<em><strong>*Edit*</strong>Looks like <a href="http://cssreboot.com">CSS Reboot</a> is back online, so a little while from now, hundreds, if not a 1000 or more sites will be officially launching new designs.  A great way to see the freshest designs and ideas out there.</em>
<em><strong>*Edit 2*</strong></em>Oh, yeah, I also gave a little face lift to the rarely used <a href="http://www.miklb.com">Miklb.com</a>
