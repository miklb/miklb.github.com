        Experiences with TiddlyWiki

    <div class="e-content">
        <p>Recently it was suggested that the Habari project think about using <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">Tiddlywiki</a> as a means to ship documentation with new releases.  At first, I wasn’t sure about the idea, but after about 15 minutes of working with it, I was hooked.  For those not familiar with Tiddlywiki, it’s a very light weight (single file) mini wiki.  I’ve seen it described as “guerrilla” wiki, or the “ipod nano” of wikis.  It highly leverages javascript to hide and show “tiddlers”, or the individual entries.  With lots of available plugins and custom themes, not to mention a very active community, TW is certainly a great contribution to the web community, and something worth checking out.  Those that are into the Getting Things Done, there’s a couple of GTD inspired adaptation, <a href="http://shared.snapgrid.com/index.html">GTDTiddlyWiki, and <a href="http://monkeygtd.tiddlyspot.com/">MonkeyGTD.  There’s also a FireFox extension, <a href="http://tiddlysnip.com/#About">TiddlySnip</a> that allows you to save snippets to your TW as a scrapbook of sorts, though I haven’t tested this extension yet.</a></a></p>

<p>The formatting in TW is different than MediaWiki, though it’s fairly easy to get used to.  There’s also a <a href="http://martinswiki.com/prereleases.html#MediaWikiFormatterPlugin">MediaWiki formatter</a>, which allows you to use that formatting in your TW (which is handy if you are copying info from a MW page.  The same plugin author is working on an importer, which I am investigating, which actually allows you to scrape MW entries right into your TW.</p>

<p>All in all, I find TW a great tool, and something I will continue to work with for a variety of uses, and hopefully will open my eyes to learning more javascripting along the way.</p>

        <p>Though there are many ways to socialize on the net (too many), I recently revisited this invite only site, <a href="http://8apps.com/">8apps.</a>  They’ve added a few more apps to the planned 8, so there’s a few more things to check out.  Not meant as a review, as I honestly haven’t spent enough time on the site to give justice, suffice to say it’s a very slick site, with a lot of potential.  It’s simply up against stiff competition.</p>

<p>That said, if you’d like to check it out, I’ve got 40 odd invites available, just leave a comment and I’ll be sure to send one.  Only thing I ask is that you after sign up, look me up (miklb) and add me as a contact, as the system doesn’t automatically add invites to your contact list.</p>

        Custom Style Sheets and Basecamp

    <div class="e-content">
        <p>I’ve mentioned that I primarily use BaseCamp these days with the company that I work with to manage the many sites they handle.  That’s all good, but whenever I log in, I am overwhelmed with many, many, late milestones and upcoming milestones.  Sure, some of it’s relevant to me, however most is not.  Even what is relevant, I’m well aware of my tardiness.  I don’t need a constant reminder :)</p>

<p>Enter a handy little Firefox extentsion, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108">Stylish</a>, that I became aware of after adopting Hicks Designs handy <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme">Mac OS styled Google Reader style sheet</a>. (Note, there are instructions for using the style sheet with other browsers).</p>

<p>Another quick use of the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60">Web Developer extension</a> (I couldn’t live without this extension), I was able to determine the class of the milestones on the dashboard (.milestones - go figure), and add a quick display:none to a custom style for the company’s Basecamp dashboard.</p>

<p>The Stylish extension easily offers you the option of using the style for a URL, a domain, or a global style, so I can be sure that it’s only being used where and when I want.  The extension author recommends using the !important declaration, however I found no need for that with Basecamp.  Certainly worth checking out if you are looking to hide some annoying element of a site you often visit.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: I went ahead and changed my style to only drop the upcoming milestones, and left the overdue ones there, as that seemed more relevant to my job.  The class for that is .Dashcal.  That way, I can still see what’s overdue, and potentially avoid issues.  Upcoming milestones I’ll leave to the project manager to advise on.</p>
