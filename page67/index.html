                <p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-franken/reflections-on-the-wellst_b_15459.html?">Al Franken over at HuffPo</a> sets the record straight regarding the Wellstone Memorial, especially in comparison to the King Service.  A point he touches on, that the conservative pundits have failed to, regarding Carter’s comments, is that Carter knew Coretta Scott King.  Recently, while watching Carter on Larry King, he remarked that he probably wouldn’t have been president had it not been for King.  He said she campaigned strongly for him in ‘76.  It just burns the Republicans that he’s still out there in the world, making things happen, and they’re busy putting out Abramhoff and Libby fires.</p>

He’s been handed a “coveted” seat on the Appropriations Committee, and get this, a seat on the sub-committee overseeing the Justice Department.  Which, just so happens to be who is investigating the Abramhoff scandal.  And while he’s at it, he got a seat overseeing NASA (the same NASA that was recently revealed to have a political appointee of Bush’s who’s been censoring its scientists on global warming, that <a href="http://scientificactivist.blogspot.com/2006/02/breaking-news-george-deutsch-did-not.html">doesn’t have a completed college degree</a> and regardless of his studies, his major was journalism).  Anyway, back to DeLay, go figure, he’s up for reelection, and now sits on the NASA subcommittee, and guess what, his home district just happens to be Houston, home of Johnson Space Center.  So anyone with half a brain can tell you that was as politically motivated an appointment as they get, and despite what anyone says, the Republicans are going about dirty business as usual.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/default.mspx">Internet Explorer 7: Beta 2 Preview</a>I never thought I’d herald the release of an IE product, and after testing it I may not be so interested, but if you’ve ever sat up until 5am trying to hack IE bugs in a completely valid site while your client in California keeps saying, “In IE…”, then the prospects of some of those bugs being gone is well, worth the annoucement.
                  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/29/445242.aspx">Annouced last July on the developer’s blog</a>, these bugs are supposed to be addressed  in beta 2.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Peekaboo bug</li>
                  <li>Guillotine bug</li>
                  <li>Duplicate Character bug</li>
                  <li> Border Chaos</li>
                  <li>No Scroll bug</li>
                  <li> 3 Pixel Text Jog</li>
                  <li> Magic Creeping Text bug</li>
                  <li>Bottom Margin bug on Hover</li>
                  <li> Losing the ability to highlight text under the top border</li>
                  <li> IE/Win Line-height bug</li>
                  <li> Double Float Margin Bug</li>
                  <li> Quirky Percentages in IE</li>
                  <li>Duplicate indent</li>
                  <li>Moving viewport scrollbar outside HTML borders</li>
                  <li> 1 px border style</li>
                  <li>Disappearing List-background</li>
                  <li>Fix width:auto</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And I’ll say a bug I spent several hours hacking last night is fixed in beta2.  Good sign (it was a lesser known a:hover background sticking bug, for those who care).</p>
                <p>Like I said, maybe a little less cursing now.</p>
