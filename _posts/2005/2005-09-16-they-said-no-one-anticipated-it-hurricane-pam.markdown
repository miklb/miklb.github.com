Much has been written and discussed regarding the preparedness, or lack there of, in Louisiana, and surrounding areas, especially regarding the levees.  So much to my surprise, I get an email today from <a href="http://www.factcheck.org"> Factcheck.org </a>, and it leads off with a link to the Louisiana Department of Homeland Security.  The <a href="http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/newsrelated/incaseofemrgencyexercise.htm">link </a> is a repost of a Times Picayune article outlining a dry run done July of 2004, before Charley and Ivan, of the effects of a <strong>Cat 3</strong> storm on the levees and underlying parishes.  Just another example of ineptness, and deceptions the administration continue to hide from.
