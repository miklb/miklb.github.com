<img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/la_purchase.png" class="right" alt="Louisiana Purchase Map">Watching MSNBC this evening, the Haitian Ambassador to the United States reminded me, and declared to the rest of the country it was Haiti who helped the United States make the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a>.  The comments were in direct response to Pat Robertson's <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0110/Robertson_Haiti_cursed_since_Satanic_pact.html">despicable comments about Haiti's "deal with the devil"</a>.

Had Haiti not defeated Napoleon's army in Saint-Domingue, the course of history would have changed dramatically.  We often forget such events, and take our country for granted, not thinking such a small country could have had such a monumental effect on our history and success.

Anyway, this bit of history aside, I can't believe there's an American alive who would want to politicize and criticize the rush to help the people of Haiti (<em>*cough*, Limbaugh, *cough*</em>).  I've tried to do my little part after seeing a <a href="http://twitter.com/servint/status/7723703494">tweet</a> that <a href="
http://www.smalldog.com/product/42760/donation-to-doctors-without-borders">Small Dog Electronics was matching donations to Doctors Without Borders</a>.  All I could think about is the families of all the people that I've worked with over the years in the restaurant business, and what if it was my family.  I know they would do the same.
