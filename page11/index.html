        <p>While revisiting the Avett Bros tonight in my music library, the next band was Archers of Loaf, which got me to thinking what was Eric Bachmann’s subsequent project up to?  So I Googled them and discovered they’re going to be in Tampa February 26.</p>

<p>One of the seminal shows I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing in Ybor City (or any where for that matter) was a Crooked Fingers show at the New World Brewery.  It was one of the coldest nights, particularly that late in winter I’ve ever known. Due to some circumstances beyond my understanding, they <strong>had to</strong> play New World, and because of the cold, had to play inside.  One thing led to another, sound issues, I don’t know, but the band played, literally, on the bar unplugged.  Mind you, there might have been 50 people tops in the place that night, but if you ask anyone now, they were there.  I mean, if you’ve ever been inside that bar, it’s not big.  They were <strong>standing on the bar</strong>, moving from as you enter counter clock-wise until they finished up the set in front of the jukebox.  If the cliché “epic” could better be applied, I’m not sure where.</p>

<p>I’ve gathered more of their music over the years, still find myself listening to the Archers of Loaf’s <cite>All the Nation’s Airports</cite> and am stoked to see a where a serious song writer’s taken his craft.</p>

        <p>I like to pride myself on knowing this little country of the USA pretty well.  I’ve driven back and forth, up and down, and just about everywhere in between.  I would have thought I knew every town that an airline like Southwest Air would service.  That is until today.  The “ding” alert was for Harlingen.  Not only did I not know where that was, I hadn’t even ever heard of the town.  But thankfully to the power of Google, I now know it’s a border town in SE Texas. South of both Corpus Christ and San Antonio.</p>
<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Harlingen&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Harlingen,+Cameron,+Texas&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.644606,-97.844238&amp;spn=6.809598,9.338379&amp;z=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;output=embed"></iframe>
<p><br /><small><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Harlingen&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Harlingen,+Cameron,+Texas&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.644606,-97.844238&amp;spn=6.809598,9.338379&amp;z=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map</a></small></p>

<p>I’m guessing then that SW Air is offering cheap flights to a border town of Mexico because there’s a stampede of people looking to tempt fate and head into Monterrey to dodge banditos for some cheap black market Viagra.  (Actually, I’m guessing it’s really for spring breakers heading to South Padre Island.)</p>

        <p>For those of you watching the Grammy’s (or just following along on Twitter) and not familiar with Arcade Fire, winner of the Grammy for best album (not to be confused with “record”) of the year, I give you the song that sold me off their first major <em>recording</em>.</p>

<p>Also, I’d like to note and ask, I’m pretty sure it wasn’t planned they’d play another song to close out the show, and the quote from the lead singer after winning, “We’re going to play another song because we <strong>like</strong> music,” was one of the best digs at the Grammy’s I’ve heard.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure why it’s taken me this long to truly discover Band of Horses.  I’d owned Infinite Arms for a while, just hadn’t really listened to it.  Perhaps it was the fact that <em>Funeral</em> is on the jukebox of my favorite dive bar, and the girlfriend of one of my close friends played it over and over after he committed suicide.  What ever the case, I’ve recently been digging into their music and lyrics, and the vibe they put out really is speaking to me these days.</p>

<p>This live acoustic version of <em>Factory</em> is a perfect example.  They were recently on Austin City Limits (The National were on the same show), and now I really want to experience them live.  Several years ago they played a SPoT show at the outdoor amphitheater in the Cuban Club, and from my porch in Ybor Heights I could hear them great.  The band shell seemed to direct the music right over the interstate onto my porch.  But I simply didn’t have the same appreciation for their sound as I do today.  Can’t wait for them to get back from Europe and travel the states again.</p>
