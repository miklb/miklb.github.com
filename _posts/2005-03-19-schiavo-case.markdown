I'd probably be remiss not to comment on this, as it's in my backyard, and seems to be a social hot point.  I certainly wouldn't want to put my family and loved ones through a similar situation.  At the same time, I wouldn't just arbitrarily cut off food and water to my own loved ones.  I found this <a href="http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/infopage.html">great blog </a> that gives some details from the case from the beginning, and it answers a lot of questions.  From what I understand what's been stated in court, I trust the <b> 5</b> judges that have decided what is best, and what the intentions were.  

This is not to say this is going away anytime soon, nor will cases like this fade off into the background as technology advances.
