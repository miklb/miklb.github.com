So I can post with this contraption, but I don't see all the options.  I see a thing for categories, but I can't see how to add them.  This wouldn't be very handy if I'm stuck with the generic default category.    I do like the idea however, of having a single interface that I post from.  So my WP Station blog, cookingwith, etc. all come from here.

<strong>EDIT</strong> OK, so I quit, and reloaded MarsEdit, and was able to "refresh" my site, and categories loaded.  Good.  I'll add my cooking site later, to see how that handles a multitude of categories.  I'm also curious about tags, but that's for another post.  I'm starting to like this "blogging client" situation.
