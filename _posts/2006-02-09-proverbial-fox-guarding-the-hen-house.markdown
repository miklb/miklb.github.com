<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060208/ap_on_go_co/delay_appropriations;_ylt=AkPc7IcFEINjwxZdiLuRqfqs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3OXIzMDMzBHNlYwM3MDM-">AP (via Yahoo)</a>  So, the old Hammer slips in shit and comes out smelling like a rose.  He's been handed a "coveted" seat on the Appropriations Committee, and get this, a seat on the sub-committee overseeing the Justice Department.  Which, just so happens to be who is investigating the Abramhoff scandal.  And while he's at it, he got a seat overseeing NASA (the same NASA that was recently revealed to have a political appointee of Bush's who's been censoring its scientists on global warming, that <a href="http://scientificactivist.blogspot.com/2006/02/breaking-news-george-deutsch-did-not.html">doesn't have a completed college degree</a> and regardless of his studies, his major was journalism).  Anyway, back to DeLay, go figure, he's up for reelection, and now sits on the NASA subcommittee, and guess what, his home district just happens to be Houston, home of Johnson Space Center.  So anyone with half a brain can tell you that was as politically motivated an appointment as they get, and despite what anyone says, the Republicans are going about dirty business as usual.
