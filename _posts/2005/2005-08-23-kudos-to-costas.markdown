<a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/08/24/arts/television/24cost.html">Bob Costas Says No to Hour on Aruba - New York Times</a> A sad story sure, but women of all ages and ethnic backgrounds go missing all over the world, and do not receive one minute of news coverage.  I certainly wonder if all the advertising $$ that the cable news networks have taken in during segments on the Holloway case were applied to missing and exploited womens groups, what the effect would be.  
That said, Costas, whom I've mentioned in a previous post as a solid fill in for King, turned down the gig based on the subject.  Clearly Costas wants to do "real" stories, I'm sure he gets enough fluff doing "feel good" stories for the Olympics.  Anyway, good for you Bob.
