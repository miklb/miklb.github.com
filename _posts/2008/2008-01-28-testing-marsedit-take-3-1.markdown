<p>Just trying out MarsEdit with Habari trunk.  Nothing to see here, move along.</p>

	<p><em>edit: it seems that MarsEdit doesn’t like posts without a tag, or the metaweblog plugin doesn’t handle it.  Either way, once a tag is added, it’s fine.</em></p>

	<p><strong>now trying to edit via MarsEdit.</strong></p>
