            <p><a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/08/24/arts/television/24cost.html">Bob Costas Says No to Hour on Aruba - New York Times</a> A sad story sure, but women of all ages and ethnic backgrounds go missing all over the world, and do not receive one minute of news coverage.  I certainly wonder if all the advertising $$ that the cable news networks have taken in during segments on the Holloway case were applied to missing and exploited womens groups, what the effect would be.<br />
              That said, Costas, whom I’ve mentioned in a previous post as a solid fill in for King, turned down the gig based on the subject.  Clearly Costas wants to do “real” stories, I’m sure he gets enough fluff doing “feel good” stories for the Olympics.  Anyway, good for you Bob.</p>

            <p>So I caught part of the President’s speech today at the VFW conference today, and as the pressure is mounting on both sides of the aisle (that was Republican Chuck Hagel, Vietnam Vet, saying that Iraq was looking more and more like Vietnam, right?), and what did I hear him invoke?  Ah, the old September 11th mantra.  Is he foolish enough to think that people are still buying that, or am I foolish enough to think people have seen through the smoke screen and realize that Iraq has nothing to do Sept 11.  Either way, with all the bickering and jostling for election positions, the GOP sure isn’t sending a united message, and the Dems are still figuring out how Dean got elected to head the party.  Meanwhile, I feel we are on a ship at 1/2 throttle with the wheel tied off so we just keep going in a big circle.  Every once in a while, we see land, and think we are going to be ok, only to veer away, back to sea.  Please, can we find someone, anyone, to stand up and take the wheel?</p>

Luckily, a judge didn’t see it that way, and ruled that there was no evidence that the research from several years ago was reversed.
In a related note, a similar case was ruled on on the West Coast regarding a species of salamander, in which the administration tried to lump several species together so as to remove them from the endangered species list.<br />
              One can only assimilate that the reason to remove these species is so development can infringe on the habitat of these endangered species.  I’d like to know a little more about what kind of development that would be.</p>

              A farewell bang is set this evening for Hunter S Thompson’s remains.</p>
            <p>Hope it’s a blast.  To have friends like that, he had to have been everything we think him to be.  I even forgive him for his pathetic bashing of the Bucs before the Superbowl.  But what better team than the Raiders, the perennial bad boys, for Thompson to be a fan of.</p>

            <p>What in the world is this really?  Is CNN trying to steal Al Gore’s cable network ideas?  All the monitors, Wolf wandering around like he’s at mission control.  It’s not real, is it?  And now they’ve moved the blogger babes out from the little desk with the laptops and 23in monitors, to their own set with GIANT monitors, and now they’re standing too.  I kinda liked the fact that they seemed they were in a back room surfing on their laptops.  Now, it’s just so, blah.</p>
