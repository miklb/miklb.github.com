<h4>Primary Hurdle</h4>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ushlambad/1047117363/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1114/1047117363_2a05422ae8_m.jpg" alt="hurdle" class="left" /></a>As I’ve <a href="http://miklb.com/calendar-syncing-lightning-google-and-nokia-e62">blogged about recently, </a>, I have been using Thunderbird 3.0 and the nightly build of Lightning calendar extension, and didn’t want to change that system.  The same issues that I had with the Nokia are present with the iPhone.  However, goosync wasn’t an option for the iPhone.  Something to do with Apple not allowing access to the built in calendar.  Some extensive Googling didn’t turn up many options, save using <a href="https://www.nuevasync.com/">NuevaSync</a>, yet another 3rd party “beta” service.  Some of the initial concerns people had with NuevaSync were sharing their Google username and password, however that’s long since been remedied, as they use Google account authentication.  Meaning, once you register with Nuevasync, you only provide your Google user name, and Google will authenticate your account with the Nuevasync account, no password is ever passed to Nuevasync.  The only downside is if you are already using an Exchange account (for email for instance), you will not be able to also use Nuevasync, as the iPhone only supports one Exchange server synchronization.  Set up for Nuevasync is well documented on their site, straight forward and very simple.  I did have a bit of trouble actually getting the iPhone calendar to sync with my Google calendar, and quite honestly, I’m not sure what I did to finally get it to sync.  Disabling, then re-enabling the account might have been the trick, but as I’ve been suffering a cold, it could have been user error, however, within their documentation, they have several troubleshooting tips and nothing I did was outside their suggestions..  Needless to say, my iPhone calendar is synced to my Google Apps calendar, desktop iCal, and Thunderbird 3.0/Lighting 1.0pre.  Unlike with goosync and my Nokia, there is no need to manually sync the calendars.  Nuevsnyc also supports sync contacts within your Google account, but I have no need to use that service, as I also believe iSync supports Google contact syncing (something I’ve kvetched about previously in that you have to have an iPhone/iPod to enable that feature).</p>

<p>Moving from calendar, next was email.  I had previously used Apple Mail.app with my Google Apps IMAP accounts, so they synced directly to the phone on first sync.  I did need to modify some advanced settings regarding mailboxes for things like drafts and sent mail, but that’s common when setting up IMAP accounts and email clients.  Google has well documented the settings, so I won’t rehash the obvious.  Previously I was using Google’s mobile mail app on the Nokia, and was a bit hesitant about using the native mail client, but so far I’ve been quite pleased with it, and have no qualms.</p>

<p>Syncing my contacts, along with email addresses in my Google Apps account was also a seamless process.  It also the catalyst I needed to do a much needed cleaning of my address book.  I’ve been a user of the (neglected) Google service <a href="http://grandcentral.com/">Grand Central</a> for some time now, and though it’s a handy one, it’s support for mobile devices leaves more than something to be desired.  My only attempt to play a voice message via their mobile site failed to play the .mp3, and from previous use on the Nokia, is all but useless.  However, I found a handy iPhone app, <a href="http://ggtenterprises.com/products/granddialer/">Grand Dialer</a>, which allows you to call a contact directly from your address book with your Grand Central number, so for the occasion you need to call a client and do not want to expose your personal cell number, you’re covered.  (Google, if you are listening, please, no, make that <strong><em>pretty please</em></strong> give Grand Central some love, even if that means a nominal monthly fee).</p>

<p>LIke any new iPhone user, I spent a fair amount of time perusing the App Store.  Again, I won’t rehash the obvious and common popular apps.  I didn’t really test any of the alternatives to the mobile versions of the desktop apps I knew I wanted.  As I use NetNewsWire on the desktop, it was an obvious choice for the iPhone.  My unread feeds are synced with my desktop, so I’m never reading feeds I’ve already read.  Also, for Twitter, I simply chose the ad supported version of Twitterific, same as on the desktop.</p>

<h4>The Camera</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3183796430"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3318/3183796430_d047f65326_m.jpg" alt="" class="right" /></a>I’d become accustomed to being one of the few people left on the planet to not have a camera on their cell phone, and didn’t think it would be something I’d take much interest in now that I did, but I did explore some of the apps available.  Merlin Mann blogged about<a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/67192250/smoke-break-by-merlinmann-ive-been-trying-to">taking pictures with his iphone</a>right about the time I ordered my phone, so I booked marked the app he mentioned, <a href="http://www.nevercenter.com/camerabag/">Camera Bag</a>.  It was actually the first app I purchased.  My next search for was for an app that would allow me to upload my camera shots to Flickr.  Flickr does have the native ability to email photos directly, however the combination of the email client and Flickr (not sure which does it), the images are resized to 640x480.  Granted if you get a really good shot and want to post the bigger one, you’ve got the image on the camera, could snyc it to iPhoto, and then upload it, but if an app could save that step, why not give it a shot?  So far, the free <a href="http://klickmap.com/">Klick</a> app seems to fit the bill.  Due to the aforementioned cold, I’ve not really explored the Klick too extensively, but I was able to upload a full size image via the 3G network with no problems, though I haven’t figured out if I can add an image to a set via the app.  The other app I’ve download is <a href="itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=298256007&amp;mt=8 ">Dark Room</a> (<em>App Store link</em>).  This app uses the accelerometer for a “steady cam”.  Basically it waits until the camera isn’t moving to snap the pic, which is handy for low light situations.  A case I’m curious about is <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/clarifi">the Griffin Clarifi</a>, which has a built in macro like lens for taking close up shots.  Apparently the iPhone lens doesn’t do well at focusing below twelve inches.  This would be handy as the technology and apps evolve on snapping UPC codes and doing info/price comparison queries.  Also for going paperless, and just snapping business cards, receipts, etc.</p>

<h4>The Final Frontier</h4>
<p>Like most people, I struggle with being organized and actually productive, and often fall into the trap of perpetually tweaking a system, rather than actually getting things done.  I’ve yet to find the right piece of software that just fits, seemingly having tried them all, Actiontastic, Omni Focus, Things, the list goes on.  However, I’m leaning towards Remember the Milk, and am testing a combination of using Fluid.app to run RTM on the desktop, and the iPhone app.  I’m not sold yet.  One iPhone app I found is <a href="http://buckaroosoftware.com/CheckOff.html">CheckOff</a>, a relatively simple list app.  What is nice about it is something I’ve not really seen in another list type app.  You can create templates for often repeated tasks.  So each time you want the list, you do not have to recreate it.  I’d actually love to have a desktop app that does the same thing.  I’m still searching for the set of tools that fit like that favorite pair of jeans, and would sincerely love for any and all suggestions.  I’d even entertain scrapping my use of Thunderbird and Lightning if the shoe fit.</p>
