Well, that little known agency shut down by Congressman Larry Craig was responsible for using scientific means of measuring the population of the salmon.  Long story short, Craig convinced his fellow congressman to shut down funding for the agency, and it looks like my faith in the people of the Pacific Northwest was unfounded." />
