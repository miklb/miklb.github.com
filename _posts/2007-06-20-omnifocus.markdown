I just got my invite for the alpha testing (yes, alpha, not beta) of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>, and I can say with certainty that I love it, and am ready to buy it now.  It just seems to be intuitive enough with just the right amount of features (and it's not done).  I certainly hope that the main interface doesn't get clogged up like many other GTD apps have done trying to be too many things to too many people.  I especially like that you can group projects.  I'll blog more once I've really had a chance to dig into it a bit more, but if you are Mac using GTD'er, you really should <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/listinfo/omnifocus-beta-announce">sign up for the beta-announcement list</a>, especially if you are not happy with the other options out there.
