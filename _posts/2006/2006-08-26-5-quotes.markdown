Saw this idea over at <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/08/five-quotes">Jason Kottke's site</a>, and thought it was a fun idea.  Sorta a meme, but not really.  At least there's no tagging, <em> yet</em>.
So here goes:

<strong>5 Quotes</strong>
<ul>
<li>You cannot acquire experience by making experiments. You cannot create experience. You must undergo it.
    Albert Camus (1913 - 1960)</li>
<li>The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself.
    Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900)</li>
<li>We only do well the things we like doing.
    Colette (1873 - 1954)</li>
<li>It is not wealth one asks for, but just enough to preserve one's dignity, to work unhampered, to be generous, frank and independent.
    W. Somerset Maugham (1874 - 1965)</li>
<li>Only he is free who cultivates his own thoughts, and strives without fear to do justice to them.
    Berthold Auerbach (1812 - 1882)</li>
</ul>
