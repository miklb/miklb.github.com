    <meta name="description" content="&quot;&gt;Palm Beach Post (second story)So when I first read about this, I thought it was much ado about nothing, a simple oversight by a transplant who registered to vote without a permanent address, blah blah, benefit of the doubt.  Now the truth comes out that she was simply a lazy bitch who didn’t feel she needed to follow the rules.  Which is how the story originally broke.  All she had to do was fill out the change of address form, and be done with it, but no, the woman who recently used the term “raghead” in reference to Arabs in a post 9.11 world, walked out of the voting precint she should have voted in, and drove to the one she originally registered in and voted.  Which, is clearly defined in FL law, as a 3rd degree felony. What I would give to see her charged." />
