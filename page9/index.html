        Using Latest DailyBooth Image
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2011-03-27T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">27 Mar 2011</time>

    <p>If you are not familiar with <a href="http://dailybooth.com/">Dailyboth</a>, at it’s core, it makes it easy to snap a picture of yourself and share it on the web.  They have a lot of other “social” aspects, like comments, following, etc, however I don’t really use any of those.  I started using it track my mustache growth for Movember, and then while I grew out a beard.  It’s easy and it can be fun.  I got to thinking today it would be cool if you could leverage that image else where besides within their network, and set off looking if they had an API and how might I do so.<img src="http://dailybooth.com/miklb/latest/medium.jpg" class="right" alt="miklb dailybooth" /></p>

<p>I discovered they do have a <a href="http://blog.dailybooth.com/category/api/">basic API</a>, along with some sample code in GitHub.  All I really wanted for now was a to pull my latest picture.  A little more digging, I realized I didn’t need to leverage the API, rather you can reference that image in a simple HTML <code><img /></code> tag.</p>
<pre><code><img src="http://dailybooth.com/username/latest/small.jpg" /></code></pre>
<p>You can also swap small, with medium or large.  The one  downside is that their images are not square, rather they are rectangular, which doesn’t work in most ‘profile’ environments.  I experimented with taking it a step further and using that latest image link with Gravatar, however from what I can tell, while Gravatar will allow you to choose the latest image, for performance reasons, they cache the various size images and don’t ever check that source again.</p>

<p>This may not be useful to many people, but in my case, with my ever changing long hair/short hair and various states of facial hair, I often find that I’ve had a photo on my about page that becomes outdated. When I meet someone in person, they hardly recognize me.  It happened when I met my current employer. Due to the nature of working on the web these days, in person meetings may not occur often or right away as most correspondences occur via email and the phone.  Having an outdated image that people are using as a visual reference isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s nice to be able to really put a face with a name, even if it’s from 2000 miles away.  Thus, I’ve updated my <a href="http://miklb.com/about">about me page</a> with my latest Dailybooth shot, so I don’t have to remember to change it.  I’m also experimenting with using it for the author bio pic at the bottom of posts, but as you can see, the aforementioned issue with rectangle vs square is an issue. I may investigate the CSS <code>clip</code> property for a short term solution.</p>

<p>It would be nice if there was a mashup somewhere between a service like Dailybooth and Gravatar where you could keep an up-to-date profile pic handy.  Possibly even being able to update your Twitter avatar at the same time.</p>

        Firefox 4 HTML5 Forms - Input Types
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2011-03-26T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">26 Mar 2011</time>

    <p>Speaking of Firefox 4, I’ve gotten a few comments on my post about <a href="http://miklb.com/firefox-4-app-tab">Firefox 4 app tabs</a>, and while trying to respond, I discovered another new ‘feature’ in Firefox 4, support for HTML 5 input types.  Inadvertently I was using the same input for my URL field as my email. I had created some custom formcontrols for  <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Dev:FormUI">Habari’s FormUI templates</a> for HTML5 support, which had the right input types, so at first I didn’t see why I was getting the error. However with help in Habari’s IRC channel from Mike Lietz, he pointed out in my theme.php file I was calling the email formcontrol for URL as well as Email.  Fixing that, I was able to submit my comment.</p>

<p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/html5_input-type_email.png" alt="Firefox4 HTML 5 input type email error" class="right" />A quick Google search turned up that , indeed, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/HTML5/Forms_in_HTML5">Gecko 2 (Firefox 4) supports HTML5 input types</a>.  I had also checked in Chrome 10.x and it too gave the same error, which means it also supports the input types. IE 9 nor Safari 5 have support for the input types (Mac, ironically the Windows version seems to support it).  Finally, Opera 10 has supported this for a while, as well as iOS Safari.</p>

<p>So what does it all mean?  Why use it if it’s not really supported in all major browsers?  Well, first, using <code> type="email"</code> or <code>type="url"</code> won’t break anything. Browsers that don’t support it treat it like a text input.  But those that do, well, as you can see in the screenshot, you get instant validation without any heavy lifting by your site.  As support grows, you won’t have to update any code.  iOS Safari support includes providing a different default keyboard layout (the ampersand and .com keys are on the home screen). I can’t speak to Android’s browser, though I’d suspect it has similar behavior.  Really there’s no reason <em>not</em> to start using them.</p>

    <p>T<img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/Firefox4_app_tab.png" class="right" alt="Firefox 4 App Tab" />he App tabs in Firefox 4 was a feature I hadn’t seen until this <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2011/03/24/firefox-4-the-app-tab-an-instant-time-saver/">handy post from Freshbooks</a> passed through Reeder.  It was immediately one of those “how awesome is that moments.”  I live in Basecamp, so that was my immediate thought.  But then, oh, yeah, Pinboard, and Instapaper.  Now I’m looking for other sites I routinely visit daily to add.</p>

<p>Speaking of Firefox 4, I was literally a day away from looking at switching to Chrome as my everyday browser, but I checked out the release candidate and pleasantly surprised by the difference.  A few days later it was formally released, and I’m no longer looking to switch.</p>

<p>Have you found any hidden gem features in Firefox 4?</p>

        Tunesday - Neko Case
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2011-03-15T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">15 Mar 2011</time>

    <p>Perhaps today’s Tunesday was inspired by the plethora of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nekocase">tweets</a> I’ve seen from her the past few days (to <a href="http://www.nekocase.com/auction/index.htm">raise money to help students with creative writing</a>), coupled with a beautiful woman I recently met giving me “bonus points” for liking Neko Case. Or it’s just that I love Neko Case’s voice.</p>

<p>I’ve had a love affair with her voice for about 8 years, since I first heard <cite>Porchlight</cite> from the soundtrack to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266971/">Slaughter Rule</a>.</p>

<p>At the time, I was working 100hr weeks, and rarely had time to find music outside of emusic.com, but I was able to get my hands on <cite>Furnace Room Lullaby</cite>.  And while I didn’t race out to buy more of her music, I often came back to that album.  A couple of years later <cite>Fox Confessor Brings the Flood</cite> was released, and if I wasn’t smitten (mind you, I’d probably never even seen her photo, it was purely the soul and emotion of her voice, not some school boy crush on a pretty face - though I now know that’s the case too).</p>

<p><cite>Margaret vs Pauline</cite> immediately joined my heavy rotation list, and is still on one of my favorite play lists.  Since then I’ve acquired <cite>The Virginian</cite>, an earlier recording, as well as what I think is her latest recording, <cite>Middle Cyclone</cite>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, by the time i discovered she was playing in Orlando a little over a year ago, the show was sold out.  I’m anxiously awaiting the next opportunity, in the meantime I leave you with <cite>Star Witness</cite> off of <cite>Fox Confessor Brings the Flood</cite>, from the aforementioned sold out show in Orlando, Florida December of ‘09.</p>

        Tables For Layout: Now Conforming
      </a>

    <p>In case you’ve been lost in all of the SXSWi hullabaloo, or just neck deep in work like myself, it seems the W3C HTML Working Group has <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011Mar/0245.html">decided</a> using role=presentation on a table element is now conforming.  So it seems after 5 years of fighting this out in the trenches, per one  rebuttal to the proposal:</p>
<blockquote>Over the past decade or more, Web designers have been moving away from tables for layout. For a while, limitations in the market leading Web browser made this somewhat impractical for sites with complicated flexible layouts that had to be compatible with a broad range of user agents, but this is no longer the case, and new sites can avoid using tables without difficulty. Old sites won't change, but old sites are not affected by changes to conformance criteria, since they already exist. Conformance criteria only affect actively developed sites, and those can move away from tables (and many avoid using tables at all).
</blockquote>
<p>The counter argument from the working group:</p>
<blockquote>
This assertion does not mention a specific example. By contrast the authors of the proposal to make <code><table role="presention"> conforming cite gmail, facebook, yahoo mail, numerous IBM applications, and toolkits such as DOJO and YUI. As each of these are actively maintained, we find that there was insufficient evidence provided to back up this assertion.

So Facebook prevails (again)?  God help us all.
