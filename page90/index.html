            <p>So CNN has this feature in their afternoon politics show, where these two chicks are surfin’ the web for blogs and what’s being discussed about the current events.  So I realize all they are really doing is searching Technorati for keywords. And though I know Technorati pulls categories as tags, a politics rant may not show up in a search about Tom DeLay.  Thus, I installed a tag generator for the site (via a <a href="http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-keywords">WordPress plugin, Jerome’s keywords</a>) so that I can start adding tags to my posts, and possibly get some hotty on CNN to read my post on air.  Is that not the most geeky thing to strive for?</p>

            <p>So I’m sitting here working, listening to CNN in the background, and the President is doing a press conference with the Prime Minister of Australia, and they open the floor to questions.  Obviously, the two pressing issues that arise are the Supreme Court and the “Leak”.  First question is about the Supreme Court, and whether or not it’s important to name a woman to replace O’Connor.  So, he stumbles around, as usual, and then says this doozy, “ I want to be known as the kind of person who does what he says he’s going to do…“<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050719.html">Link to transcript of press conference</a>.
Now, concerning the “Leak”, didn’t he say that if anyone that was involved worked in  the White House, they’d be fired? And hasn’t he basically recanted that statement in the last few days? So, Mr. President, which is it going to be, a “person who does what he says he’s going to do”, or a person who does what he’s told to?</p>

            <p>Now, don’t get me wrong, I despise the Rove machine, and all it stands for.  Which really however, is the root of what Jon Stewart said this evening about the Rove/Plame “scandal”, and that is, it’s not really about legality issue, its just another example of how this administration on the surface says and does one thing (see videotapes of Rove being interviewed, denying any involvement at all, McClellan vehemently denying any White House involvement, Bush’s statement about firing leaks), then under the surface the White House was involved, Rove did have a hand in it, and  Bush has  no intention of firing, not to mention even distancing himself from those involved (see the smirk on Rove’s face today exiting Air Force One with Bush).  All the allegations of back room deals, war for oil, all come rushing to the surface when situations such as this occur.  The logical conclusion has to be that if they are capable of lies about outing a CIA agent, or if not out right outing (we still don’t know who the first Novak source is) then why wouldn’t someone believe that Cheney really did have closed door meeting with the  energy companies, or that the administration really did have a plan before 9.11 to invade Iraq, and that contracts with Halliburton were already in place?  As the old saying goes, where there’s smoke, there’s fire.</p>

            <p>The national media had to latch onto the Rove story.  No matter how many other global events occurred- hurricanes, bombings, pregnant no-talent bleach blondes attending film premiers- the story just didn’t go away.  The question now is, what will come of it.  Already, the lead talking heads from the Dem’s camp are posturing; Henry “Let’s call an investigation at the drop of a dime” Waxman, Harry Reid (who actually has had the most reasonable response I’ve read from the “left”) and now I’m hearing even good ol’ Kerry is waking up from the nap he’s been taking since last fall.  But will all the clamoring, all the rankle, simply be spun as being a witch hunt, or will the Dem’s do the smart thing, and stand back, and give Bush and his boys enough rope to hang themselves?
 <a href="http://www.tinylittledots.com">Tiny Little Dots</a> discusses the media growing a pair, and one would hope that considering the ramifications the case has had on how journalists will be able to do their job, I for one, expect them to take to task the red meat this story is exposing.  But if the “frog march” that Joe Wilson first spoke of is to happen, the patient persistence of the media and left is the only way to let middle America take hold of this, and only then will Bush and co. be forced to take action.</p>
