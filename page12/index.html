        <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/imageclectic/5604423448/" title="Telegraph Key by wblj, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5604423448_7acc49ff46.jpg" class="right" alt="Telegraph Key" /></a>I’ve been really enjoying both the <a href="http://www.lib.unc.edu/blogs/civilwar/">Civil War Day By Day</a> Blog, as well as the Disunion series in the Opininator from the <cite>NY Times</cite>.  Earlier this week Disunion had an article,  <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/communication-breakdown/?ref=opinion">Morse, The Telegraph &amp; Civil War</a>.  The gist of the article is that the advent of the Telegraph allowed for quicker and faster communication, and coupled with advances of the printing press, allowed for more newspapers to take hold, each with their own <quote>partisan orientation.</quote></p>

<p>This speed of communication allowed for the schism between North and South to broaden.</p>

<blockquote>Instead, of course, national unity unraveled as antagonistic North-South stereotypes hardened during the 1850s.  The dominant modern narrative of mid-19th century American history suggests that North and South began to see each other more clearly — and that each discovered how genuinely different the other had become. While a fast-changing North embraced progress and improvement, the South remained wedded to an archaic, retrogressive labor system. Under the circumstances, Northern and Southern outlooks and values necessarily diverged.</blockquote>

<p>What struck me most though about this article is how it parallels today’s current events and how the advances in technology and the internet can be directly attributed to the uprising in the Middle East, as well as to some degree the political discourse in our own country.  The 24 hour news cycle, and the fact that anyone can start a blog/website to argue their stance has really changed the way politics is done in the United States. We just had our first presidential candidate announce his candidacy via Twitter.  A politician was run out of Washington due to his use of Craigslist and the ability of a website to get a hold of the email exchange and image to quickly get it out, being picked up by mainstream media, resulting in his resignation within days of the story hitting the web.</p>

<p>Guess it goes to prove the old adage, <em>The more things change, the more they stay the same.</em></p>

        <p>I have had this draft sitting around for awhile, but in the last two days I’ve seen the word “blog” used incorrectly several times, and decided to dust this off and publish it.</p>

<p>You have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog</a>.  When writing for this web log, you are blogging, “I think I’m going to <strong>blog</strong> about the movie we saw last night”, I <em>blogged</em> about how I built the best mouse trap. You can call yourself a blogger.  <span class="pquote-r"> A blog however is not each individual entry or post you write.</span> Please do not tell me you wrote 3 blogs last night.  You can tell me you blogged 3 articles, or you wrote 3 entries for your blog, but you did not write 3 blogs. Do not tweet “my new blog” and link to an entry. When I see “new blog” I’m expecting a completely new site from the one you already have.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t claim to be a grammar nazi or even have the best grammar. But this is less about grammar and more about semantics and something that simply gets my goat.  Feel free to contradict or refute my position. I’m all ears.  Also, I came across a great blog <strong>post</strong> sometime back, <a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html">on the history of weblogs</a> you may find interesting.</p>

Why? It’s a little late for citrus in general. Also, my native ass says kumquats are an even earlier citrus.  Also, they look similar (not really).  Taste: no comparison.  A super ripe loquat to me is a cross between a mango and peach. And heaven. Relish the wild loquats our fore fathers planted and the birds have spread Ybor and Seminole Heights neighbors. They are a treat.</p>

        <p>If you are not familiar with <a href="http://dailybooth.com/">Dailyboth</a>, at it’s core, it makes it easy to snap a picture of yourself and share it on the web.  They have a lot of other “social” aspects, like comments, following, etc, however I don’t really use any of those.  I started using it track my mustache growth for Movember, and then while I grew out a beard.  It’s easy and it can be fun.  I got to thinking today it would be cool if you could leverage that image else where besides within their network, and set off looking if they had an API and how might I do so.<img src="http://dailybooth.com/miklb/latest/medium.jpg" class="right" alt="miklb dailybooth" /></p>

<p>I discovered they do have a <a href="http://blog.dailybooth.com/category/api/">basic API</a>, along with some sample code in GitHub.  All I really wanted for now was a to pull my latest picture.  A little more digging, I realized I didn’t need to leverage the API, rather you can reference that image in a simple HTML <code><img /></code> tag.</p>
<pre><code><img src="http://dailybooth.com/username/latest/small.jpg" /></code></pre>
<p>You can also swap small, with medium or large.  The one  downside is that their images are not square, rather they are rectangular, which doesn’t work in most ‘profile’ environments.  I experimented with taking it a step further and using that latest image link with Gravatar, however from what I can tell, while Gravatar will allow you to choose the latest image, for performance reasons, they cache the various size images and don’t ever check that source again.</p>

<p>This may not be useful to many people, but in my case, with my ever changing long hair/short hair and various states of facial hair, I often find that I’ve had a photo on my about page that becomes outdated. When I meet someone in person, they hardly recognize me.  It happened when I met my current employer. Due to the nature of working on the web these days, in person meetings may not occur often or right away as most correspondences occur via email and the phone.  Having an outdated image that people are using as a visual reference isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s nice to be able to really put a face with a name, even if it’s from 2000 miles away.  Thus, I’ve updated my <a href="http://miklb.com/about">about me page</a> with my latest Dailybooth shot, so I don’t have to remember to change it.  I’m also experimenting with using it for the author bio pic at the bottom of posts, but as you can see, the aforementioned issue with rectangle vs square is an issue. I may investigate the CSS <code>clip</code> property for a short term solution.</p>

<p>It would be nice if there was a mashup somewhere between a service like Dailybooth and Gravatar where you could keep an up-to-date profile pic handy.  Possibly even being able to update your Twitter avatar at the same time.</p>

        <p>Speaking of Firefox 4, I’ve gotten a few comments on my post about <a href="http://miklb.com/firefox-4-app-tab">Firefox 4 app tabs</a>, and while trying to respond, I discovered another new ‘feature’ in Firefox 4, support for HTML 5 input types.  Inadvertently I was using the same input for my URL field as my email. I had created some custom formcontrols for  <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Dev:FormUI">Habari’s FormUI templates</a> for HTML5 support, which had the right input types, so at first I didn’t see why I was getting the error. However with help in Habari’s IRC channel from Mike Lietz, he pointed out in my theme.php file I was calling the email formcontrol for URL as well as Email.  Fixing that, I was able to submit my comment.</p>

<p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/html5_input-type_email.png" alt="Firefox4 HTML 5 input type email error" class="right" />A quick Google search turned up that , indeed, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/HTML5/Forms_in_HTML5">Gecko 2 (Firefox 4) supports HTML5 input types</a>.  I had also checked in Chrome 10.x and it too gave the same error, which means it also supports the input types. IE 9 nor Safari 5 have support for the input types (Mac, ironically the Windows version seems to support it).  Finally, Opera 10 has supported this for a while, as well as iOS Safari.</p>

<p>So what does it all mean?  Why use it if it’s not really supported in all major browsers?  Well, first, using <code> type="email"</code> or <code>type="url"</code> won’t break anything. Browsers that don’t support it treat it like a text input.  But those that do, well, as you can see in the screenshot, you get instant validation without any heavy lifting by your site.  As support grows, you won’t have to update any code.  iOS Safari support includes providing a different default keyboard layout (the ampersand and .com keys are on the home screen). I can’t speak to Android’s browser, though I’d suspect it has similar behavior.  Really there’s no reason <em>not</em> to start using them.</p>
