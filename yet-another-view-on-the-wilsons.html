Turns out he didn’t become <em>their</em> lawyer until one day, as their <strong>neighbor</strong>, he read an op-ed by one Robert Novak, informing him that his neighbor was really a CIA agent.
Just another face to the impact that Scooter and Karl had with their little game.  How anyone can continue to defend them is beyond me.</p>
