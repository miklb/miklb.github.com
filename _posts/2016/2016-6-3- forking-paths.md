summary: Jeremy Keith's superb walk down the history of the web and how to get from a walled garden to a forking path.
---
In no small part I started down the path of rebooting my personal site employing the tenets of IndieWeb principles because I read about it on [Jeremy Keith's weblog adactio](https://adactio.com/). It took some time to come to fruition, with lots of starts and sputters, and I still have itches to scratch.

I wasn't surprised then when I read his post from his recent talk &lt;A&gt;. He does a superb job of starting from the beginning of the web and coming full circle to where we are today with "walled gardens" and how we do not have to lock ourselves into them.

I would like us all to spend more time in the garden of forking paths. I would like us all to continue to grow this garden of forking paths. Add your own website to this garden of forking paths. Use it to make more links.
