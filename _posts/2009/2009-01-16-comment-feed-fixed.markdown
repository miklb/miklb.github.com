Little did I know that I needed to create a separate feed for comments at Feedburner for it to actually work with the Feedburner plugin for Habari.  So if for some reason you wanted to subscribe to site wide comments vs a single post, it's now working.  I've also added recent comments to the sidebar, complete with a spiffy excerpt of the comment.  Thanks to whomever created the summarize function, it only took a PHP n00b like myself a couple of minutes to figure out how to have a <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Recent_Comments">separate comment content excerpt in Habari</a>.
