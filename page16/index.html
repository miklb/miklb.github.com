              <div class="e-content">
                <p>The first blog post I read about<a href="http://leoville.com/buzz-kill"> moving away from Twitter &amp; microblogging</a> began my thinking of how I might do the same.  I came into the “blogging culture” late in the game, so I didn’t have as much an identity as some.</p>
                <p>However, lately I’ve been feeling more and more my <em>microblogging</em> platform of choice, Twitter, was becoming increasingly ephemeral.  I was conditioning myself to minimize my thoughts due to some arbitrary constraint.  Not to mention, I didn’t have my own reference point.  Sure, I use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">
                    Instapaper</a> &amp; <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, but I did not have a chronological reference to what I was thinking and feeling. Not to mention a real reference point of meaningful information I felt important to file away for posterity.</p>
                <p>So today launches a new direction for Michael B, one where I do not question if I can get my point across in a finite set of characters, if my use of UTF-8 character encoding will translate to other platforms.  Where I can come back a year later and the data will be mine, easily reached, in a database of my own management.  No worries if I post a picture if someone will sell it, if my words will be broadcast to ears to which I’ll never know.</p>
                <p>I don’t mean to say I will not be verbose (which I am) or that I’ve mastered some modern day <cite>Strunk &amp; White</cite>, rather I will not feel confined. And to which I will feel free.</p>
                <p>Also, I will genuinely get back to the root of why I fell in love with publishing on the web, and hopefully make some, albeit small, mark on the face of web publishing.</p>
                <p>This is just but the first iteration of the new site. I hope to integrate some of the third-party services that I previously shared on this domain, and still feel an important way of expressing fully who I am, but I needed to make the move now, and fill in the important pieces as I move forward once again.</p>
                <p>I’m quite happy this is <strike>(not valid due to old content)</strike> HTML 5 with generous dashes of CSS 3. I hope to expand on both and as I learned my first go around with self-publishing on the web - learning is doing. (<em>Update: I was going to switch the videos to the experimental Youtube HTML5 embed code, however unfortunately the videos had been taken down. I also found additional typos in the same post. The home page is now currently valid HTML5</em>)</p>

              <div class="e-content">
                <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/riverspring/5028694522/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5028694522_b364c8b4d9.jpg" class="right" /></a>This past weekend was the 3rd <a href="http://barcamptampabay.org/">Barcamp Tampa Bay</a>. Afterwords, Peter Radizeski one of the original organizers tweeted <a href="http://twitter.com/radinfo/status/25640430439">“how do we keep the community talking between BarCamps?”</a>, to which my answer was that I believe the key is to foster the “mini” communities that come together at Barcamps, and that cross pollination amongst the smaller communities will keep the discussions going.  To which Peter replied he didn’t think the cross pollination was working.  I respect all of the work that Peter has done to help build Tampa Bay tech communities.  I think we move in slightly different “mini” communities, so perhaps there are some that don’t cross over as much as others, but I will say in the 2 years since BarCamp 2008, I genuinely believe that it is happening.  Perhaps not as fast as some would like, but it wasn’t that long ago that I didn’t know a single person in real life working with WordPress, web development or web technologies in the Tampa Bay area.</p>
                <p>I was someone who had switched careers, was working from home freelancing, and all of my interaction was online.  I used to joke that I had more friends in the industry overseas than I did in the Bay area.  Now that is not the case.  Perhaps partly from the proliferation of services like Twitter, but I now know real live human beings living in the Bay area who work with similar technologies as myself.  That circle grows larger every time I attend a local event, be it Barcamp or more recently, the local <a href="http://tampabaywordpress.org/">WordPress User Group</a>.  I don’t get to <em>hang out</em> with these people as much as I’d like, but that’s the case with my friends not in the industry too.  Life just gets in the way.</p>
                <p>I do think there is a responsibility for those who want to see a more thriving community locally to as I said, foster the smaller communities and try and bring the Barcamp sharing and nurturing mentality to their smaller circles.  Perhaps it’s time someone reaches out to Ryan and the <a href="http://floridacreatives.com/category/tags/tampa">Florida Creatives</a> to start an active, local chapter to help bring the smaller communities together.  Maybe there’s another umbrella organization that just hasn’t been started.  Are people put off by the term “creative”? I honestly don’t have the answer.  I know earlier this year myself and several others discussed what possible umbrella organization could help achieve this, and nothing came of it.  Maybe it’s time to revisit the conversation in a broader scope?  I was speaking with an organizer of BarCamp Sarasota and they do events year round under the BarCamp moniker.  Is BarCamp evolving from the DIY stick-it-to-the-man un-conference into a “brand” that people can associate with and can be that umbrella?  Again, I don’t claim to have all of the answers, but certainly would love to see the discussion continue, and will continue to make efforts in my smaller circles to build a local community of web technologist for the Tampa Bay area.</p>

              <div class="e-content">
                <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/4964990093"><img class="left" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/4964990093_6f51f336e8_m.jpg" /></a>I picked up a Canon SX-20 IS several months back, but due to a variety of reasons, I’d not really taken it out yet and started shooting pictures with it.  Nor have I done much digital photography using manual settings, so today I set out to remedy that.  I’m a complete novice when it comes to fully understanding aperture, shutter speed and ISO speeds, but I’m determined to learn.  So far the Canon SX-20 seems to be the perfect place to start.  With that said, this is by no means a <em>review</em> of the camera as I’m completely not qualified to comment on what is right or wrong with the camera.  I chose it based on feedback from a couple of amateur photographers whose knowledge of photography I respect.  They both had the SX-10, and based on the features and cost, the SX-20 seemed not to be too far from what the SX-10 offered.</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/4965589398"><img class="right" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/4965589398_f2e3f5b490_m.jpg" /></a>Today I primarily tried to just get used to adjusting the f-stop and shutter speed to get a good balance.  I primarily stuck with 400 and 800 for ISO.  Having never used a digital camera to adjust these settings, it certainly seemed like a good starting point for getting familiar with the controls.  All and all, by the end of the walk along the board walk at Lettuce Lake Park, I was feeling fairly comfortable with the controls and adjusting the two settings.  I’m still getting familiar with finding objects in the viewer when trying to locate a specific object (like a certain flower or the Cuban Yellow Warbler).  Certainly something with practice I’m sure I’ll get the hang of.  I also need to pay more attention to my light source, but for having not picked up the camera in several months, I think  I got a few good picks, which is probably more of a testament of the camera than my abilities at this point.  I am however confident that this camera will be a great learning tool as well as have the ability to capture some nice images.  Now I can’t wait to read up a little more on balancing ISO with shutter speed and f-stop, as well as just get out and take more pictures.  Next time I’m thinking about a more urban setting like Ybor.</p>

                <p><em>Note:</em> These are completely untouched with any post processing. I really want to see the original image so as to compare as I continue to learn.

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>I was  a quasi punk teenager when I first traveled to Hyde Park to experience “art”.  Sure, I’d done the Ybor thing, but this was high end stuff as far as I had experienced it.  A live performance of actors was way more than seeing Black Flag do 3 songs then run off stage.  This was <em>School of Night</em>.  I honestly don’t remember the skits, but I do remember Jeff and another actor doing a scene from a Sam Shepard piece (<em> I think </em> it was from <cite>True West</cite>).</p>
                <p>As I grew older, I took advantage of the opportunities to experience Jeff’s larger performances with troupes like  <a href="http://www.americanstage.org/">American Stage</a>.   During this time, I was introduced to Jeff through a mutual acquaintance.  He was humble, brooding.  Everything I had pictured an artist to be.  I was jealous.</p>
                <p>I thought him an older but kindred spirit, not a celebrity.  He <strong>was</strong> an artist.  I got a glimpse of a genius.  Someone who was so comfortable with his art; perhaps tortured in the fact that he was such a craftsman of his art that he could perform it in a burgh such as Tampa.  He trusted that there were like minded souls who also parked their tent in this god-forsaken mosquito ridden peninsula of peninsulas a genuine art scene would evolve.  I know I cooked food with that same passion.  I regret I didn’t stay true to my own passion…</p>
                <p>I for one apologize for being so shortsighted I didn’t realize it sooner–yes, I wanted a dynamic, brilliant local scene. And there is one. Theatre, food, dance… it’s all there.  Maybe not how I envisioned it because I wanted brilliance such as Jeff’s to be national news, and in my youth I lost my vision.</p>
                <p>However, in the twilight of my own perspective, and in the sunset of the passing of Jeff Norton, I reflect on that first night in a little corner bistro at Howard and Azeele, and pray that the baton of pure passion and art will continued to be passed.</p>
                <p>God speed Jeff Norton, god speed.</p>

                  On Second Thought… Thinking Before Sending

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>I <a href="http://twitter.com/miklb/status/18948707688">tweeted</a> Monday “having a scratch text file to cut and paste stuff you want to think about before sending/posting/saying is one of my better ideas…”.  This elicited a couple of responses, a bit to my surprise, as I was basically saying it out loud to myself as a reminder to use this principal.  I have all too often fired off an email, tweet, forum response, or comment on a post full of knee jerk reaction, emotion and haste.  Only to regret it as soon as I hit send, wishing I had thought through the ramifications of the response.</p>
                <p>I wanted to clarify a bit on how/why I do this.  As I’ve said, the main reason is if I have this unsaved text file already open, then I can quickly cut and paste the response to this file, move on to what ever it was I was doing before writing the response, and revisit later.  This is different than crafting thought out responses in advance of posting or replying, which as <a href="http://seancoates.com/">Sean</a> suggested in one of the responses to use Notational Velocity.   I have well <a href="http://miklb.com/note-taking-nirvana">documented my love of Notational Velocity</a>, and do indeed use it in this scenario.  These are thoughts that I ruminate over, that I want to save even after posting or sending.</p>
                <p>I also didn’t mean to suggest that this was some ground breaking idea or that it might be completely original.  It is simply something that I have found works for me and prevents me from putting my foot in my mouth or worse.  It allows me to get something off my chest and get the emotional element on <em>paper</em>, but move on without any ramifications.  If after some period of time I still feel the need to respond to what ever it is, I can go back to this file, pull the relevant elements out the response, and temper the emotional aspects and pragmatically respond.  However, if after some time, I feel the response is unwarranted or moot, I simply let it go.  Having it as an unsaved file, I then figuratively “let it go” by closing the file without saving.  For what ever reason, I feel if I save the file, I’m somehow hanging onto these thoughts which I’ve already deemed unworthy of sending.  Hanging onto these thoughts, whether figuratively or literally, I find unhealthy for myself. They simply are added baggage to an already overfull luggage rack in my mind.</p>
