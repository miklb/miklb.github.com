                <p>Ahh.  Red tide, heat indexes of 105º +, rising housing costs, traffic, Jeb Bush…all reasons to hate living in Florida, and Tampa in particular.  But this morning, I walked for three hours in waist deep water, watching aquatic life teeming around me, all the while with the “twin cities” of Tampa and St. Petersburg bookending my morning.<br />
                  Granted, I misapplied my sunscreen, thus I have splotchy red spots, and my fishing partner took home the grand prize of a 24 inch red (drum) fish, however, my world sorta slipped back onto its axis, as I maintained my realization that 5am drunken rooftop parties are no longer for me.
 Drop me a contact if you live in the Tampa Bay area and would like to experience the splendor that is Florida land based fishing.</p>

Not that you will see that in the National Hurricane Center forcast until the other models pickup on it, but, after last year, I don’t take anything for granted.

                <p>Ah, the trials and tribulations of off line life vs on line life…Anyway, I was sitting with some friends, talking geek talk, and made a political analogy off the top of my head, that after second thought, wasn’t a bad idea, in some contexts.  The idea was this…if the right wing machine was <em>so-o-o-o</em> worried about one Hillary Rodham-Clinton running for president, and the effects a Hillary presidency would have on the agenda, then why not appoint <em>her</em> to the Supreme Court?  She was a Washington lawyer at one time, and there was discussion of appointing a non judge anyways.  It would have totally taken the wind out of the lefts sails, and taken her out of any running for presidency.  Sure, she would have been some what influential on the Supreme Court, but she would have been only one of nine.  Then they could have put a serious conservative to replace Rehnquist, and set a conservative to be Chief Justice.</p>
                <p>Ah well, it was a common sense and Microsoft analogy anyways…</p>

                  So it seemed that there was no real “dirt” to stick to Roberts, that perhaps the White House nominated a “good guy”, who just happened to be nominated by the right.  Even former lawyer for Clinton endorsed him.  (Not that I take that too far).  But now it’s coming out, that Roberts is a card carrying member of the ultra conservative right, and worse, he doesn’t “recall” getting his card.  How do you head a steering committee and not remember.  Or worse,  fake an association with a club simply for personal gain, only later to deny it.  Is that the best America has to put on the Supreme Court?</p>

                  So, after Apple sees the popularity of the widget,  they incorporate the idea into Tiger, without as much as a kiss before they screwed the developers of Konfabulator (or that’s how I read it, when the widgets were first previewed), and thus taking the feet right out beneath the developer.  Thus, Konfabulator is released as freeware. With Versiontracker filled with widget after widget, and me still plugging away with Panther, I just might stick a few up on the desktop to “pretend” to be hangin’ with Jones.
                  <strong>Edit*</strong>Ah, Yahoo bought Konfabulator, and had every intention to make it free.  So alls well, that ends well.  And I did grab a couple of widgets for fun…</p>
