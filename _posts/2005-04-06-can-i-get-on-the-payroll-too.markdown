He's been on a lot of bloggers radar for some time, and even I in my short time of doing this had to point him out.  I just find it ridiculous that he can continue to avoid a full blown investigation.  At least those <i>left wing</i> media giants CNN began running his face with a blurb about the story.

It seems good ol' Tom has been raking in the bucks into his PAC, and doling out hundreds of thousands of dollars to his wife and daughter.  When asked about it, his spokesperson pointed fingers saying so-and-so pays their family members too.  However, the amounts just do not seem to even be comparable.  
I keep asking the question, at what point will the stink stick to this guy?  Even Frist has stepped away from some of the statements recently made by DeLay.  Is that the sign?
