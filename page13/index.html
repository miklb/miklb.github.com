                  Towards a Responsive Design

              </h1>
              <time datetime="2011-03-13T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">13 Mar 2011</time>
              <div class="e-content">
                <p>I am not sure I had really paid attention to the term <em>responsive design</em> when I started the redesign for this site. I just knew I wanted something that would be as readable on an iPhone as it was on my large desktop monitor.  I made some conscious decisions to remove a bunch of extraneous elements not for the mobile viewing, but I simply wanted to focus attention on what ever it was I was writing about.  Sidebars full of links, tweets, buttons and badges might have been novel 6 years ago when I started this site, but not so important to me now.</p>
                <p>I also wanted to learn more about HTML5 and CSS3.  For my own site, I’m completely not interested in supporting old browsers, save for using a HTML5 polyfill for &lt; IE 9.  If someone is using IE 6, they probably don’t have much interest in what I’m sharing anyway.  So I played with some max-widths and widths based on percentage until I found something that worked for me.  Perhaps that’s not the best way to approach it, as the site really should be about those visiting, but I guess <span class="pquote-r">I made an assumption my browsers/screen resolutions/mobile devices were common enough that if it looked OK to me, it should look OK to visitors.</span>  Up until today, I was fairly happy with what I had come up with, save for the Youtube videos I’ve been posting.  I have been experimenting with using the HTML5 iframe wrapper Youtube offers, and choosing a very large version of the video.  Which wasn’t working out for smaller screens.</p>
                <p>But as I’m studying more about the advanced concepts of responsive design and using media queries, I ran across Ethan Marcotte’s <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images/">fluid images</a> post.  Lo and behold, I set &lt;pre&gt;<code>iframe {max-width: 100%}</code>&lt;/pre&gt; and my video posts scale along with the surrounding content.</p>
                <p>I’m not sure I will mess with this site anytime soon code or design wise, but I do intend to experiment with using the <a href="http://lessframework.com/">Less Framework</a> and possibly the intriguing <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_images_experimenting_with_context_aware_image_sizing/">context aware responsive images</a> script over on my <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking site</a>, which is a blueprint based grid design spun off of the markup of this site.  I don’t think it would take much to convert the grid to the Less Framework.  I may think about a design that’s not quite as similar to this in the process.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the direction, I’d like to thank Kevin Zurawel for his <a href="http://arborwebsolutions.com/2011/03/wordcamp-miami-2011/">WordCamp Miami session on responsive design</a> and piquing my interest on the subject even more.</p>

                <p>I finally got around to setting up <a href="http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/">Tweet Nest</a> at <a href="http://tweets.miklb.com">http://tweets.miklb.com</a>, to archive, well, my tweets.  Seems Twitter only goes back so far, so I don’t have <strong>all</strong> of them, but I think I have an archive somewhere that does. May look at figuring out how to add those in at some point.  Tweet Nest is a very cool little open source app.</p>

              <div class="e-content">
                <p><strong>Update:</strong> The plot thickens.  <a href="http://seancoates.com">Sean Coates</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/coates/status/47642561044680706">pointed out on Twitter this morning</a> that the Twitter API announcement has been pulled, with no obvious response.  Most of the mailing list message is still available in an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/mar/14/twitter-developers-client-warning">article in the Guardian</a>.</p>
                <p>First, I’m not a developer of software.  I make websites. I use Twitter. A lot sometimes. <img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/dead_bird_twitter.jpg" class="right" alt="" />  I have found the reaction to Twitter’s curious <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a">announcement in the change in their terms of service</a> interesting.  Granted, most reactions I have read are from developer types, so it may be biased.  The sentiment  could be summed up in a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GlennF/status/46442047980310528">tweet I saw today</a>, “Twitter: from #dickbar to #dickmove”. That basically Twitter added a new “feature” in their most recent mobile app that absolutely no one liked and users were abuzz with suggestions for other clients.  Rather than listen to these users (granted, they did release a minor update that apparently mitigates to a degree the trending bar, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/06/dickbar">coined by Gruber</a> the <em>dickbar</em>) they simply decided to post to a mailing list telling developers to not plan on being able to create alternate clients.  Poor timing? Possibly. They very well could have been planning this announcement for some time.  Still seems odd.</p>
                <p><span class="pquote-l">But what if they had challenged themselves internally? </span>  “We are going to make such a kick ass experience for the desktop, mobile and web, users won’t bother with these imitators.”  They could have looked at who was doing great things with the iPhone and the desktop and simply hired them to make their product better.  Listened to their users to see what features these other clients were offering and <strong>make them better</strong>.  Isn’t that what free-market competition should be all about? Not, “hey, thanks for helping build up our user base, now go screw yourselves.”</p>
                <p>Ultimately, Twitter really reminded me that I don’t pay for it, so I can’t really bitch about it, and should remember my goal of <a href="http://miklb.com/less-twitter-more-me">Less Twitter, more me.</a>.</p>

                <p>While revisiting the Avett Bros tonight in my music library, the next band was Archers of Loaf, which got me to thinking what was Eric Bachmann’s subsequent project up to?  So I Googled them and discovered they’re going to be in Tampa February 26.</p>
                <p>One of the seminal shows I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing in Ybor City (or any where for that matter) was a Crooked Fingers show at the New World Brewery.  It was one of the coldest nights, particularly that late in winter I’ve ever known. Due to some circumstances beyond my understanding, they <strong>had to</strong> play New World, and because of the cold, had to play inside.  One thing led to another, sound issues, I don’t know, but the band played, literally, on the bar unplugged.  Mind you, there might have been 50 people tops in the place that night, but if you ask anyone now, they were there.  I mean, if you’ve ever been inside that bar, it’s not big.  They were <strong>standing on the bar</strong>, moving from as you enter counter clock-wise until they finished up the set in front of the jukebox.  If the cliché “epic” could better be applied, I’m not sure where.</p>
                <p>I’ve gathered more of their music over the years, still find myself listening to the Archers of Loaf’s <cite>All the Nation’s Airports</cite> and am stoked to see a where a serious song writer’s taken his craft.</p>

                <p>I like to pride myself on knowing this little country of the USA pretty well.  I’ve driven back and forth, up and down, and just about everywhere in between.  I would have thought I knew every town that an airline like Southwest Air would service.  That is until today.  The “ding” alert was for Harlingen.  Not only did I not know where that was, I hadn’t even ever heard of the town.  But thankfully to the power of Google, I now know it’s a border town in SE Texas. South of both Corpus Christ and San Antonio.</p>
                <iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Harlingen&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Harlingen,+Cameron,+Texas&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.644606,-97.844238&amp;spn=6.809598,9.338379&amp;z=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;output=embed"></iframe>

                <p>I’m guessing then that SW Air is offering cheap flights to a border town of Mexico because there’s a stampede of people looking to tempt fate and head into Monterrey to dodge banditos for some cheap black market Viagra.  (Actually, I’m guessing it’s really for spring breakers heading to South Padre Island.)</p>
