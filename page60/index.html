                <p>New services around the country are reporting that good ol’ Tom “The Hammer” DeLay is stepping down from his bid to run again for Congress.  Couldn’t be better news to me.  I just wonder why it’s taken so long.  Perhaps he got advanced warning of the extent of Tom Rudy’s cooperation, and pending charges that will be harder to shake.<br />
                  I also wonder if those who donated to his re-election can ask for a refund, and how the successor is chosen.  A run off between the remaining 3 candidates?
I also wonder if Bush and the Rove machine will continue to stand by their man, or will attempt to distance themselves and the White House from DeLay.
I’m sure some answers will come sooner than later, but that’s at least one perpetrator of the culture of corruption that won’t be influencing the laws of our country, and won’t be perpetuating the good ol’ boy network on Capitol Hill come this fall.</p>

                  In case you’ve been asleep the last 4 days, Abramhoff got 5 years 10 months for his role in the Sun Cruz line purchase.  Still to come are sentences for his multitude of other indiscretions while a lobbyist.  Though that sentence is bound to be lessened based on his cooperation with prosecutors, and run concurrent to these charges.  I really hope these prosecutors are holding out for DeLay, and not just Ney.</p>

                  I’d really like to meet the genius who came up with this idea.  “Hey, we can turn a negative into a positive if we simply start counting any puddle as wetlands.  Heck, the golf course that surrounds my new house must have at least 15 ponds, let’s start counting those…ah screw the pesticides and fertilizers that filter into the ponds…”.
As a Florida native, it breaks my heart every time I take a drive through an area that once used to be “swampy”, and now is condo, or subdivision.  I do enjoy playing golf, but would never trade a cypress swamp for a course.  And nor do I think my goverment should either.</p>

                <p>Sign me up.  Got the call from the local cable company, Brighthouse tonight saying that with our current package, I can add VOIP telephone and and twice as much download rates for Road Runner for basically half of what I pay monthly for my traditional phone service.  And they claim they have battery backup for phone service in case of power outage (we keep an old fashioned phone around for those just in case moments, though a cell phone now makes it less used).  How can you beat that.  And one less bill a month to deal with.<br />
                  So if anyone has any experience with the digital phone service, I’ve still got two weeks before they come to install, I’d really love some feedback.</p>
