Well, two months into the year, and I'm still struggling with a good GTD system.  I am using Actiontastic still, but for work, I'm using <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com">Fresh Books</a> to time track and invoice clients.  (For those that care, I've gone full time into web work.  Mostly WordPress, but I've done a fair amount of non-WP work.  My working site is <a href="http://www.bishopblogworks.com">Bishop Blog Works</a>. Please understand the design is in flux).

Fresh Books is great, but I can't get my clients to use the ticket system.  Email is still their method of choice for notifying me of needed changes, for both active projects, and site tweaks.  Fresh Books says they will have an email to ticket system, but if that doesn't materialize sooner than later, I may have to look at another option.  In the meantime, I try to take the email, add it to iCal as a todo using <a hfref="http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html">Mailtags</a>, then sync iCal with Actiontastic, and THEN add those as tickets/tasks in Fresh Books.  

Not working out so well.

On a positive note, I've streamlined the home office, clearing out a lot of clutter, which I believe makes it easier to get started in the morning and stay focused.

If anyone has a suggestion for converting emails to a time tracking system, I'd love to hear about it.  I have started looking at <a href="http://kingdesign.net/tasks/">Alex King's Tracks </a>, as it has an email to task ability, but the demo doesn't seem to allow for that.  It requires running a cron job on your server, and since Alex is setting the demo up on his, I don't see a way to test that feature.  If it works, I could have clients send an email that is picked up by Tasks, and then time track straight from that.  But then I'm back to either having two "apps" for time tracking/invoicing.  Hopefully Fresh Books will roll out that feature soon, and I'll be good to go.  I then simply forward a copy of the ticket to Mail.app, add it to Actiontastic, and it's automatically added to a ticket.  Or at least that's how I'd draw it up on paper.
