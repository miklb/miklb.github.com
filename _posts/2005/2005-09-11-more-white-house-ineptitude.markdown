 has done some looking, and it appears that the Bush administration, in their back slapping of pre-hurricane state of emergency annoucement, <strong>FAILED TO MENTION THE COASTAL PARISHES!!</strong>  Check out the map Bob's got at his site, and the link to the whitehose.gov press release.  So far, he's found no explanation.  Good one McClellan.
