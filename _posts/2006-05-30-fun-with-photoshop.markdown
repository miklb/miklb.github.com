<img class="left small" src="http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/funwith.thumbnail.jpg" alt="funwith" /><img class="left big" src="http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/funwith.jpg" alt="funwith" />So I took a little time to just have fun with some <a href="http://www.magurno.com/">new brushes</a> I found, and just create an image for the sake of doing it, not for a web graphic, not a photograph for someone, just to create.
Felt good.
