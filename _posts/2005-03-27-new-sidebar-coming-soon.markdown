I am on a quest to research some of those <a href="http://www.alexking.org/index.php?content=software/wordpress/themes.php">139 Wordpress themes over at Alex Kings site</a>, and weave together a side bar I like.  Not that anyone is visiting yet, but by god, when they do, it will be snazzy.  I really want to change the header image as well, the image is just a little, well, blurry.
