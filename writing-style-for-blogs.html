              <p>I’ve been trying to blog more, but tend to write these long diatribes, which smack against the conventions of online writing that I’ve read.  I used to tell myself that I blogged for my own benefit, and that I didn’t care if anyone read it, but I’m fooling myself.  Every time I write something, I find myself checking stats and looking for comments, so obviously I do care. To that end I am also looking to tailor my blogging style to cater to easier digestion, regular readership and the potential for a discussion to ensue.</p>
              <p>I have a <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2008/03/15/21/">few references</a> (actually, Bleacher Report has quite a bit of good reference, be it sports related or not), but am looking for more.  Do you have any quality references for online writing?</p>
              <p><em>Update</em> - I’ve found a few links that have some good information.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A collection of articles by<a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/"> Jakob Nielsen on writing for the web</a></li>
                <li>Actually linked from the previous set of articles, but worthy of listing again, <a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v1/articles/web-writing-for-many-interest-levels.htm">web writing for many interest levels</a>, is very informative.  I particularly like the methodology list.</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/contribute/styleguide/">A List Apart's style guide</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>I’ll update this list as I find additional resources.</p>
