OK.  I'm officially going to start blogging here at bloggingmeta, to what ever degree that means.  It may just be a few things web related, and setting up a lifestream, but I will relegate my personal domain for just that, personal blogging, be it political or what not, but all things internet/blogging/web related will go here.  I'm really excited about using Habari, and have wanted to start using this domain for some time.  Now that the DB is somewhat stable, and not as many chances of having to dump the db, I think I'll be fine.  Here's to the rest of my life while I'm at it.
