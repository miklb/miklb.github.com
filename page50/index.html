                <p>I did a google search for the solution to a problem I had with some CSS and image links, and didn’t find a good solution, so I’m throwing this out there for anyone who might stumble upon it.
The problem I was having was that I was creating a site with a black ground.  There was a global setting for all a:hover links to have a background color and different font color, a common effect.  However, any image links that I had were also getting a small box of the same color at the bottom when I moused over it, not at all good looking.  I tried setting the selector a:hover img to a black backgroud, but the color still showed up.  After closer inspection of my style sheet, I had set a global marign and padding on all images.  When I set those to zero, the color didn’t show up.  However, I didn’t want to sacrifice all images to not have to margin or padding, or force the end user to add a special class to images, so I tried setting the a:hover img margins and padding to zero.  The problem there was that the image would “jerk” when moused over, as the margin and padding shifted.  So I simply set a img to zero margins and padding, and my problem was solved.  The only down fall is if someone wants to post an image in a blog post that’s a link, the text will butt right up against it.  However, if that problem arises, I can then set a class for that image, and should be able to give the image room. 
Anyway, like I said, I didn’t find a solution in the first few pages of google, not that this will make those pages neccessarily, but it’s worth throwing out there.</p>

                  Ha!  So it appears Lieberman’s campaign whining about being hacked really was a case of being a cheap skate.  Hell, I pay $10 a month to host all my sites.  Republicans, you can have him.</p>

                <p>What a horrible month it’s been.  I’m finally set up in my new digs with my internet and a environment that I feel comfortable enough to start truly moving forward, no matter how small the baby steps are.<br />
                  The worst of it all is a dear man, a troubled genius, someone whom I was honored to call my friend, took his life this week.  I’m not too comfortable with talking about it yet, perhaps at some point I’ll blog a little more.  I’ll just say that the world took a shot to the kidneys this past Monday evening when my friend Mike O’neill took his life.
                  <a href="http://tinylittledots.com/wordpress/?p=725">Tiny Little Dots</a> has already posted a little more about it, so I’ll leave it to his site to fashion out the extended links.</p>
                <p>I mourn losing Miguel, and I mourn for those who held him even closer than I.  May the next part of the journey bring more solace than the last.</p>
