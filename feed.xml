Siri this, iOS 10 that. And I’m sure some of the ideas are great and I’ll be happy when they are at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all I want is for Apple to include the font from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/&quot;&gt;WWDC web site&lt;/a&gt;. When the site launched, it took me some time to realize the page is a giant image. A simple monospaced font on a background you’d find in a terminal or code editor app. It’s beautiful and I want it for my own.&lt;/p&gt;

I would have loved to attend in person, but a cross country flight wasn’t in the cards. Fortunately, the organizers have long had plans in place to accommodate remote attendance by providing live video feeds of demonstrations as well as covering a couple of the breakout sessions on Saturday. IWC also has a robust IRC channel which will facilitate participation on build day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary goals beyond furthering my understanding of the technologies behind the IndieWeb is to switch back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://webmention.io&quot;&gt;webmention.io&lt;/a&gt; for receiving webmentions. Aaron Gustafson updated his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io&quot;&gt;Jekyll plugin&lt;/a&gt; and I like the idea of cached mentions as well as the idea of using progressive enhancement in displaying them. This will entail taking the mentions from the current tool and formatting them to match Aaron’s cache file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I want to wrap my head around syndicating from micropub and begin to use it more. I believe there is a workflow out there, I just need to fully understand how to wire them all the bits together. If time permits, also in the micropub realm, I want to get mobile publishing set up.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile I had launched my first blog with WordPress, fresh off the 1.5 release that brought full themes, XHTML and CSS. Reading blog posts on the subjects was basically the way I learned those skills. And viewing the page source of the authors writing those posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2016, and I still view source. More often than not now, I’m learning from GitHub repositories. Which is why finding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree&quot;&gt;Octotree&lt;/a&gt; browser plugin was such a find. Rather than having to navigate back and forth inside a repo, you get a tree view of the files to the left of the browser window. If you find your self using the back button and navigating breadcrumbs, I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

Lesson learned today is take the little twinges of discomfort serious. I had minor discomfort in my right ankle but pushed through, and am now feeling that I was compensating for it. I may need to wait until Friday to start the next week, but that’s to be determined. Consider me day-to-day on the injury report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other take away from today was, despite being a native Floridian, it’s easy to forget the seriousness humidity contributes to the &lt;em&gt;feels like&lt;/em&gt; temperature. I may want to start timing my runs for morning, or later in the evening (though the summer weather patterns might not play nice with evening runs in general.)&lt;/p&gt;

As exhilarating as day one was, I was equally sore the next day. Though I try to walk a little every day, there are muscles you use to jog that don’t come into play walking. That said, I wasn’t deterred, and today was my planned day 2. The schedule is 3 days a week for the first 3 weeks at least, I didn’t look beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I did learn from day one was to not push the jog too hard to start, and was able to pace myself a bit better today. I also tried to zig-zag around the neighborhood rather than do laps around the small park near my house. The laps felt a bit too monotonous, as I was checking the app to gauge progress. Snaking through the neighborhood didn’t feel that way. It may have slowed me a bit as I didn’t have a route planned, but the app maps the run so I can check back and have a clearer idea of what would be a good loop. Speaking of, on my geek side, I’m looking at ways to export the .gpx file and create a static map of the run and post with these posts, much like the static map I created with my Instagram photos.&lt;/p&gt;

In my case, I was seeing hundreds of blank lines creating the page navigation at the top of the page. It doesn’t affect what the visitor sees, but for developers who use Jekyll poor source is a bad practice. Also imagine someone new to Jekyll and HTML in general trying to view source to debug an issue. Turns out the problem is with the Liquid template language Jekyll uses. Seems the Liquid community have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/216&quot;&gt;discussing the issue&lt;/a&gt; for 3 years without a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first approach to solving this was to use a Ruby gem &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier&quot;&gt;HTML Beautifier&lt;/a&gt;. It works great, but for a site like mine with over 500 posts with a lot of tag pages, it increases the build time exponentially. To the point I’ve seen Travis time out due to the long process. Today I went looking for another solution and stumbled upon this &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kerotaa/5788650&quot;&gt;gist - remove empty lines&lt;/a&gt;. It concerned me the plugin would increase the build time in Jekyll vs in Travis, but was pleasantly surprised it added no noticeable overhead and produces much cleaner HTML output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I get quick build times and cleaner source.&lt;/p&gt;
