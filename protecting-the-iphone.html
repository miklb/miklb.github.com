    <meta name="description" content="Finally made it out of the house after a week of being holed up sick, and stopped off to get a case for the iPhone.  First stop was the Apple store, only to be terribly disappointed with the selection.  I did however pick up some anti-glare film, which as advertised “provides traction for improved responsiveness”.  I was worried about bubbles, but it applied just fine, with only one small bubble, however the anti-glare totally hides it when the phone is on.  From there, I hit Best Buy and grabbed an inexpensive, utilitarian silicone case.  It’s quite sufficient for now, at least until I get a dock, not sure it would fit in one, though it’s a fairly thin sleeve.  I’d highly recommend the anti-glare film to any iPhone user." />
