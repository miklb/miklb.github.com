I’ve gotten several emails pushing for her support, and come across a couple of blog posts as well, so I took a minute to check out her credentials.  Not your soccer mom got bored, or super rich white girl with nothing better to do type of candidate.  It’s also my understanding that a recent Democrat convert is being supported by the DNC.  I hope that’s not the case, and all because one may have a few more dollars than the other.  Shame shame." />
