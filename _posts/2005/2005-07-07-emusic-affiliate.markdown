A quick advertisement (did I say that on a personal blog), but I so highly recommend this site for such a long time, that I have no problems advertising it along with personally subscribing to it.  Labels like Merge, Matador, Bloodshot, 4AD, not to mention Jade Tree and Polyvinyl.  All done in VBR Mp3 format.  Consider Itunes is $.99 a track, the basic plan offers 40 tracks a month for just $9.99.  You do the math.  Best part is they offer a free trial of 50 downloads, so you can't go wrong (and I get a kick back for every trial, so help me pay for my hosting while you fill in that back catalog of the Pixies, Pavement, and check out the new album from Daniel Lanois)
