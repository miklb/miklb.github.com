There has been much buzz the past week regarding comment/trackback spam around the net.  Discussions regarding a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/16/AR2006051601873.html">cyber spam war</a>, threads all over the WP support forums, and blog post after blog post regarding spam.  Meanwhile, I sit wondering am I missing out on something?  Do the spammers simply not like me?  I've gotten one or two Spam Karma digests, with a few caught spams over the past week, but nothing like the "100s" of spams I've seen people mention.  I didn't think I was doing anything exceptional to protect against spam.  I'm running <a href="http://www.homelandstupidity.us/software/bad-behavior/">Bad Behavior</a> and <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/">Spam Karma 2</a>.  No Akismet, the golden child of WP lead developer Matt Mullenweg, no captchas, nothing else.  
Then I wonder, is it because I've donated to both plugin developers, that I really do have Spam Karma on my side?  Either way, know if and when I get an adsense deposit, that a portion of it will go again to both plugin developers, just in case ;-)
