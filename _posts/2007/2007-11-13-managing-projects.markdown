<img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/projpier_ss.jpg" class="right" alt="">Much has been written the last few years about project management, <a href="http://miklb.com/tag/GTD">GTD</a> (getting things done) and productivity on the web, I personally subscribe to probably a dozen feeds that are specifically geared towards the subject, and have tried probably every conceivable idea, all to little success.

For my paying work, I work with a company that exclusively uses Basecamp, and have come to be quite familiar with the system, but can't rationalize paying for the service for my own needs.  I do have a backpack account, but never quite have gotten a system in place there to do basic project management.  Now that I have 2 themes released for Habari, and several other small projects I'm working on, mulling over, I went looking last night for something that resembles Basecamp, but was under my own control, and if I ever wanted to collaborate with someone, could easily add them in.  I then remembered, <a href="http://www.activecollab.com/">Active Collab</a>, an <s>open-source</s> clone of Basecamp. (Active Collab is now closed source, and a commercial product.  Their old, .7.1 release is still available for download.  If you want an interesting read about how open source goes bad, read the <a href="http://www.activecollab.com/old-posts/pricing-details-updated/">blog post</a> and comments regarding the new structure.)

Realizing it was now commercial, and priced completely towards businesses, I read through some comments and saw reference to <a href="http://projectpier.org">Project Pier</a>, a fork of Active Collab.  A new .8 release fixing some bugs and adding a few features to the .7.1 release of AC was out, so I snagged a copy and installed locally.  Very easy to install  (assuming you meet the server requirements), and after a quick read of how to change the god awful default theme, I was up and running, in a familiar PM environment.  I set up projects for my two themes, added some milestones, todo lists, poked around and decided that though I'm the only one using it, I could easily use the messages for personal notes.  And if I ever decide to put it on my own domain for others to collaborate with, I can easily migrate the database, and keep my current work intact.  It also seems powerful enough that a small design house or programming team could use it for real projects, as it supports file uploads and RSS feed for recent activity.  I haven't explored email notification, however I believe it handles that ala Basecamp as well.  (Like Basecamp, I don't think you can reply to a message via email however)

All in all, a very useful tool, and I'd like to applaud the team behind Project Pier for picking up and forking in light of the changes in the development of Active Collab.  I'll be keeping an eye on it's progress, and am looking for good things to come.
