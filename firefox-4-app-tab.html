          <p>Speaking of Firefox 4, I was literally a day away from looking at switching to Chrome as my everyday browser, but I checked out the release candidate and pleasantly surprised by the difference.  A few days later it was formally released, and I’m no longer looking to switch.</p>
          <p>Have you found any hidden gem features in Firefox 4?</p>
