              <p>If anyone else in the Central Florida area is going, I’d love to connect in advance, and possibly have someone to “know” in advance.  There are two dinners, one the night before, and one the night of, so having even a somewhat familiar person to break bread with would be nice, though I’m fairly good at making new acquaintances and meeting people.  (Probably from years of sitting in bars and chatting up the person next to me.)</p>
              <p>Also, if anyone has advice for attending an event of this nature, I’m all ears.</p>
