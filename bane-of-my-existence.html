    <meta name="description" content="I’ve been a home owner for a little over 5 years, and for the most part, haven’t thought twice about the decision.  That is, until the toilet acts up.  That damn thing has been nothing short of the proverbial thorn in my side from day one.  Leaking, not flushing, overfilling, you name it, I’ve dealt with it.  And being the “manly man” that I am, I’ve done all the repairs myself, even when I’ve made huge mistakes like chipping the tank where the fill valve seats, and having to hunt down some kind of epoxy/resin to fill in the chips so the tank would fill and not leak.No matter how many times I’ve replaced the ballcock, refill valve, handle, lever, 3 months later this thing stops working properly.  I feel like I’m a Marine with an M16 when it comes to the thing.  I could take it apart and put it back together blindfolded.  Today wasn’t too bad, I had to take the ballcock apart, and clean a little gasket inside, reseat it, and adjust the lever to allow the float to rise.So set the timer, by August, something will have to be replace." />

                No matter how many times I’ve replaced the ballcock, refill valve, handle, lever, 3 months later this thing stops working properly.  I feel like I’m a Marine with an M16 when it comes to the thing.  I could take it apart and put it back together blindfolded.  Today wasn’t <em>too</em> bad, I had to take the ballcock apart, and clean a little gasket inside, reseat it, and adjust the lever to allow the float to rise.
