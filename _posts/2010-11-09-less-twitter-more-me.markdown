The first blog post I read about<a href="http://leoville.com/buzz-kill"> moving away from Twitter & microblogging</a> began my thinking of how I might do the same.  I came into the "blogging culture" late in the game, so I didn't have as much an identity as some.

However, lately I've been feeling more and more my <em>microblogging</em> platform of choice, Twitter, was becoming increasingly ephemeral.  I was conditioning myself to minimize my thoughts due to some arbitrary constraint.  Not to mention, I didn't have my own reference point.  Sure, I use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">
Instapaper</a> & <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, but I did not have a chronological reference to what I was thinking and feeling. Not to mention a real reference point of meaningful information I felt important to file away for posterity.

So today launches a new direction for Michael B, one where I do not question if I can get my point across in a finite set of characters, if my use of UTF-8 character encoding will translate to other platforms.  Where I can come back a year later and the data will be mine, easily reached, in a database of my own management.  No worries if I post a picture if someone will sell it, if my words will be broadcast to ears to which I'll never know.

I don't mean to say I will not be verbose (which I am) or that I've mastered some modern day <cite>Strunk & White</cite>, rather I will not feel confined. And to which I will feel free.

Also, I will genuinely get back to the root of why I fell in love with publishing on the web, and hopefully make some, albeit small, mark on the face of web publishing.

This is just but the first iteration of the new site. I hope to integrate some of the third-party services that I previously shared on this domain, and still feel an important way of expressing fully who I am, but I needed to make the move now, and fill in the important pieces as I move forward once again.

I'm quite happy this is <strike>(not valid due to old content)</strike> HTML 5 with generous dashes of CSS 3. I hope to expand on both and as I learned my first go around with self-publishing on the web - learning is doing. (<em>Update: I was going to switch the videos to the experimental Youtube HTML5 embed code, however unfortunately the videos had been taken down. I also found additional typos in the same post. The home page is now currently valid HTML5</em>)
