Alas, the world keeps turning, and so does the clown rodeo kown as the Tomd DeLay defense.  His lawyers are know trying to squash the money laundering because “wire transfers are not ‘funds’ “… if that’s not a backhanded admission of guilt, nothing is.  “If the glove does not fit, you must acquit”.  And to further the never give in persona of ol’ Hammer, he passed on a plea offer of a misdemeanor charge of violating Texas election laws, thus the felony charges that he currently faces.  Tom, you shoulda listened closer to the <em>Gambler</em>, “you gotta know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em…”</p>

As the <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at200524_model.html">computer models</a> have her slightly lower than the Tampa area, the most recent <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT4+shtml/190236.shtml">discussion</a> talks of some slightly different motion than previously forcast, and how the recent NOAA jet’s flight data would have on the models.  Keep an eye out folks, it ain’t over yet.</p>

                <p>Yes, I haven’t blogged in a while, and yes, I’ve been busy cooking for a living again.  However that doesn’t mean I don’t intend to continue blogging, nor do I completely ignore the news.  That said, I was shocked when I heard on the news today that U2 was doing a fundraiser for Rick Santorum.  Then I read over at <a href="http://joetrippi.com">Joe Trippi’s site </a> that ol’ Santorum and the conservative news blogs got the message wrong.&lt;blockquote&gt;Santorum . . . you may want to wipe those eggs off of your face&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And was just starting to think the world was really slipping off its axis. Whew!  Not just yet.</p>

                <p>I was checking my recent referers, and saw that I had several referals from <a href="http://www.seminoleheights.blogspot.com">Seminole Heights Blog</a>, and the discussion of the bay area being “blog capital of Florida”.   I rarely discuss Tampa issues, and funny enough, I just came across an <a href="http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBAWR2F6EE.html">article</a> at tbo.com discussing Tampa officials wanting to ease laws regarding gifts of tickets.  When I read the article, I almost wrote about it then.  But after reading the discussion, I feel I must touch on it. 
                  <!--more-->
                  The article discusses the desire of Iorio and city council members wanting to be allowed to accept tickets that cost more than the $100 that they are currently allowed to accept.  And my question is this, what events are you wanting to go to that cost more than $100?  The article discusses “community events”, but I’m not aware of these events.  If they are fundraisers rather than community events, I would question who is raising the funds, and why exactly do they need the mayor or a city council person there?  Iorio discusses a USF game recently.  Last time I checked, tickets were less than $100 to the game.  Likewise in Dingfelder’s Bucs game issues.  Tickets can cost much less than $100.  Now, in my humble opinion, if these elected officials want to hang out in a luxury box, and eat a catered meal, drink top-shelf cocktails while watching a football game rather than sit in the seats with those who elected them, then they should pay for the difference out of their pocket.  Likewise, if it’s a fundraiser, be it children’s causes or Gasparilla, I’m uncomfortable with event planners being able to bring in the mayor for free, which may be a “selling point” to those wealthy enough to attend.  Smells fishy all ready.</p>
