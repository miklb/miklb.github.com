          <p>I’ve officially made the change from Habari to Jekyll. I will certainly have more to share on the move, both a post-mortem on Habari, as well as the process I’m using currently for using Jekyll.</p>
          <p>My basic workflow currently is serving the page from GitHub pages, however I’m using Travis CI to build the site and  publish to master branch<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> , there by bypassing the restrictions of gh-pages (specifically, their need for using –safe mode and not up-to-date version of Jekyll). Currently my use case would probably work within their parameters, however I had already started using 3.x and at the time of writing GitHub is using 2.x.</p>
          <p>More importantly to me, I want to be able to blog from my phone. It something that I feel has limited me in sharing interesting items I come across as well as stopping me from making time to put thoughts down as they come. I had originally wrote up <a href="http://miklb.com/first-thoughts-holy-grail-of-blogging-from-ios-with-jekyll">some thoughts on using iOS and Jekyll</a>, but later came across a better workflow<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
          <p>Finally, there are still some wonkiness around, I’m sure my Atom feed is broken and am not sure how to redirect that yet using GitHub. I doubt I had many subscribers, so if you stumble on this and previously read my random posts, you may need to update while I investigate options. Certainly there are some styling issues that I want to address as well as some under the hood improvements.</p>
