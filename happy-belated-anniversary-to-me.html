I tried doing something with just about every free resource out there, it just never “took”.  It wasn’t until my friend over at tiny little dots adopted WordPress, and thus I installed it on my newly purchased domain, did the light go on.  At once I felt at home.  I immediately begin cramming massive amounts of CSS knowledge into my already crowded head. I now can I say I can see myself actually putting food on the table and a roof over my head some day doing this stuff full time.  I’ve got a long way to go, and need to particularly see where I “fit in”, but it is quite exciting, a feeling I lost quite some time ago in regards to cooking." />

              <p>So a hardy thank you to tiny for adopting WP and to <a href="http://www.7milesdown.com/wp/">trench</a> for my first blogroll link.  Also a big thanks to the many people who’ve stopped by and left a comment, it’s always nice to know someones reading the site :)</p>
              <p>I’m really looking forward to seeing what the next year of doing this brings, what direction things will go, but if the first was any indication, it’s going to be great.</p>
