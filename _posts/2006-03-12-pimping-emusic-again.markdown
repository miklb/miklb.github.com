I just can't say enough about this <a href="http://www.emusic.com">site</a>, and have been that way for the 5 on and off years I've been using it.  I've downloaded everything from Charlie Parker to the Cows.  Some of the recent stuff I've downloaded includes <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/11573/11573581.html">Tres Chicas</a>, <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/11506/11506025.html">Minus the Bear</a>, and some old stuff including <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/11625/11625629.html">fIREHOSE's </a> if'n.
So if you are interested in a free trial -50 downloads (will require credit card, but won't be charged unless you don't cancel after month), and want to help me get some free downloads (if you like the service and keep it after the month trial, I get 50 downloads myself), leave a comment or use my <a href="http://www.miklb.com/contact">Contact Page</a>.  I'll send you the special link that will help me get the hook up too.
