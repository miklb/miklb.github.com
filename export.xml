        <title>Creative Focus Summit - Day 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my mind, a new year started December 1st. Well, on a personal level I should say. Professionally, I‚Äôm looking forward to something to share come the first of the year. Between then and now, my primary goal is develop some habits that will be necessary to balance a workload unlike anything I‚Äôve tackled before. So I was intrigued when &lt;a href=&quot;http://shawnblanc.net&quot;&gt;Shawn Blanc&lt;/a&gt; announced the free &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefocuscourse.com/summit/&quot;&gt;Creative Focus Summit&lt;/a&gt;. While I knew it was partly marketing for his Focus Course, I‚Äôve been reading his blog long enough to know that it wouldn‚Äôt be a gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some bullet notes I took from the first two conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jocelyn-k-glei-jkglei&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jkglei.com/&quot;&gt;Jocelyn K. Glei&lt;/a&gt; @jkglei&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value emerges as the product of focused work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on doing your best creative work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 90 minute focus blocks in morning. Don‚Äôt open brain to other people‚Äôs ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make todo list night before. Wake up knowing what you want to accomplish. Deep attention work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hyper attention - can be interrupted, editorial/curatorial items later in day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mark McGinnis - different templates for the day. Not about one routine to rule them all, but set of routines based on context of where work is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gary Keller - The One Thing (book)‚Ä¶best work is way out on fringes‚Ä¶seasons of life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create built in feed-back loop. 3 month cycle, daily schedule&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make time for reflection - time for course correcting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time for exploration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;calendar is best place to go on offense&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 todo lists - 1 we write down, email and calendar bring them into alignment (for me email == async comms‚ÄìBC, GitHub issues)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rhythm of the constant optimization ??? Work/life balance more about Fitz and starts, track how you are doing, journal at end of day small wins/progress (Progress principle)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;metric is the accomplishment itself, not the system to track how productive you are.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;completion bias - checking off things that may not be part of the deep focus project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a Stop Doing List!!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;todd-henry-toddhenry&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toddhenry.com/&quot;&gt;Todd Henry&lt;/a&gt; @toddhenry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making tough choices creates value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;focus is how you define the problem you are tying to solve, and working on most pressing problems/solve those problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Projects come as as a result of a set of problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define work by establishing challenges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what you do know but not doing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top 3 problems always around you. in front of you consistently (Phone screen, at bottom, clear apps to make room)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;establish adjacency - clustering attention&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;continuous partial attention &lt;it me=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/it&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;theme - afternoon less taxing, early day creative work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Circles - Three Questions for your Circle: (1) What are you working on right now? (2) Is there anything we can help you with? (3) What‚Äôs inspiring you right now? Would be a great bi-weekly coffee get-together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;innovation happens in the white space&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dedicate time every day to study, take notes and truly contemplate what you are taking in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what do you with the stuff you take in? How does this apply to my goals/ambitions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fake work is more dangerous than no work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create for yourself but not necessarily in the same vein as your ‚Äújob‚Äù.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Couple of thoughts I jotted down were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a way to make sure world isn‚Äôt on fire without getting sucked into social media/lesser news&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to have research materials in place BEFORE starting focused work to avoid rabbit holes of search. Bookmarks, tabs already open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After day one, I‚Äôm looking forward to the rest of the week‚Äôs conversations and hearing more about the course now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday - Margo Price</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm just now catching onto Margo Price, but if you are a fan of classic country without the commercialization, then she is right up your alley. Calling her &lt;em&gt;classic country&lt;/em&gt; probably isn‚Äôt a fair characterization, but I‚Äôve never been good with music genres anyway. However you slice it, she‚Äôs a brilliant song writer with a sound that is both familiar and fresh at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This selection from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2016/11/22/503055186/margo-price-tiny-desk-concert?utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=music&quot;&gt;NPR Tinydesk series&lt;/a&gt; is a perfect primer. I look forward to her making a trip to the Tampa area in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My New Favorite Cover of Hallelujah</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a rough two weeks emotionally for a lot of us, maybe this cover of &lt;em&gt;Hallelujah&lt;/em&gt; in Yiddish will have some healing effects as it did for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure what it says about my coding, but there is a special feeling doing something that doesn‚Äôt involve copying a Stack Overflow answer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the question should be less why do pull quotes exist, but why are sites lazy in their implementation. There are already solutions to only show the quote once, both with just &lt;a href=&quot;http://miekd.com/articles/pull-quotes-with-html5-and-css/&quot;&gt;HTML/CSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200609/automatic_pullquotes_with_javascript_and_css/&quot;&gt;javascript&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôm sure other solutions could be found.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Inspiration is for Amateurs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tina Roth Eisenberg often has great quotes on her blog, SwissMiss. Catching up on my feeds this past week, she shared a quote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swiss-miss.com/2016/07/get-to-work-2.html&quot;&gt;‚ÄúGet to Work‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; that struck a nerve as I‚Äôve been guilty of &lt;em&gt;waiting for inspiration&lt;/em&gt; all week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The advice I like to give young artists, or really anybody who‚Äôll listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work.

If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to do an awful lot of work. All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swiss-miss.com/2016/07/get-to-work-2.html&quot;&gt;Chuck Close&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

        <title>Jekyll &amp; Microblogging</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been following Manton Reece‚Äôs blog and his development of a microblogging service. The first thing that caught my attention was when he discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://manton.org/tag/civilcomments&quot;&gt;supporting webmentions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today he outline he is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manton.org/2016/07/building-on-jekyll.html&quot;&gt;building on top of Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. One interesting thing is that he‚Äôs adding XML-RPC. Considering my recent advances in implementing micropub here, I guess I was secretly hoping that was something he was baking into his new platform and MarsEdit was going to add it. Maybe in the future. Regardless of the technology, I‚Äôm excited for another platform that gives people the opportunity to own their voice and step out of the feed lots of the corporate web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of micropub and Jekyll, &lt;a href=&quot;http://voxpelli.com&quot;&gt;Pelle&lt;/a&gt; released his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; today. It‚Äôs still in early development, and requires deploying to Heroku, but is what I‚Äôm using here. My goals now are to add support to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb&quot;&gt;Jekyll-IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; project and help document setting it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I‚Äôm bullish on Jekyll, and hope these advances and the addition of theme gems in 3.2 continue to broaden the appeal of the platform. Perhaps to the point I could find work developing and supporting it. But that is for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forking Paths</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In no small part I started down the path of rebooting my personal site employing the tenets of IndieWeb principles because I read about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Keith‚Äôs weblog adactio&lt;/a&gt;. It took some time to come to fruition, with lots of starts and sputters, and I still have itches to scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn‚Äôt surprised then when I read his post from his recent talk &amp;lt;A&amp;gt;. He does a superb job of starting from the beginning of the web and coming full circle to where we are today with ‚Äúwalled gardens‚Äù and how we do not have to lock ourselves into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I would like us all to spend more time in the garden of forking paths. I would like us all to continue to grow this garden of forking paths. Add your own website to this garden of forking paths. Use it to make more links.

        <title>Losing Steam</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had built a pretty good habit of writing and using the blog as my primary source of commentary, but a glitch (I think, which this post is partly to debug said issue) slowed me down using micropub, the holy grail of being able to post first here and syndicate to social media. Coupled with the easy trap of using Twitter, and here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my personal reminder the work I put into this site is about owning my voice and words, and to find the time to reduce the friction to do so. Also, to share that experience so that others can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Plans for Jekyll IndieWeb Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started a project soon after I began embracing the IndieWeb for the Jekyll platform, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb&quot;&gt;Jekyll IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; (A less than inspiring project name I‚Äôm afraid to say.) My initial goals were to have a framework for myself that was fully microformats 2 compliant to build my own site off of and to share a starting point for anyone new to having their own website and wanting to embrace IndieWeb themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I know of one person who is using it, which is encouragement enough to continue looking at ways to improve it. In the upcoming release of Jekyll, themes will be supported. While considered a minor enhancement, I think its a major milestone for Jekyll. Previously, there was no simple way to change the look and feel of your site without manually copying files into your install. Most theme projects are packaged as standalone Jekyll builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that said, my plan moving forward to is to package the microformated theme, complete with the same config options as a Gem under the name ‚ÄúCrier‚Äù (as in town crier. Not sure it‚Äôs anymore imaginative than the original project.) The original GitHub project will switch to the Gem once the new version is released, but will stay as a standalone Jekyll install for anyone who wants to get started from scratch. Also, Tom began working implementing a webmention gem for sending while at &lt;a href=&quot;https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2016/06/07/indieweb-summit-2016-demos/&quot;&gt;IndieWeb Summit 2016&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of Bear in the IndieWeb community, I hope to have a tutorial and example of using continuous integration to build and deploy a site back to GitHub allowing the sending of webmentions along with the already supported receiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear from anyone else interested in the project or using it, and what else you would like to see. Long term goal is micropub support.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Simple WWDC Wish: The Font</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My feed reader and Twitter timeline are full of posts with wish lists for next week‚Äôs Apple World Wide Developer conference. Siri this, iOS 10 that. And I‚Äôm sure some of the ideas are great and I‚Äôll be happy when they are at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all I want is for Apple to include the font from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/&quot;&gt;WWDC web site&lt;/a&gt;. When the site launched, it took me some time to realize the page is a giant image. A simple monospaced font on a background you‚Äôd find in a terminal or code editor app. It‚Äôs beautiful and I want it for my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;u-photo&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn.miklb.com/images/WWDC_-_Apple_Developer_2016-06-09_03-30-35.png&quot; alt=&quot;WWDC screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IndieWeb Summit 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://2016.indieweb.org&quot;&gt;2016 IndieWeb Summit&lt;/a&gt; in Portland Oregon. I would have loved to attend in person, but a cross country flight wasn‚Äôt in the cards. Fortunately, the organizers have long had plans in place to accommodate remote attendance by providing live video feeds of demonstrations as well as covering a couple of the breakout sessions on Saturday. IWC also has a robust IRC channel which will facilitate participation on build day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary goals beyond furthering my understanding of the technologies behind the IndieWeb is to switch back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://webmention.io&quot;&gt;webmention.io&lt;/a&gt; for receiving webmentions. Aaron Gustafson updated his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io&quot;&gt;Jekyll plugin&lt;/a&gt; and I like the idea of cached mentions as well as the idea of using progressive enhancement in displaying them. This will entail taking the mentions from the current tool and formatting them to match Aaron‚Äôs cache file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I want to wrap my head around syndicating from micropub and begin to use it more. I believe there is a workflow out there, I just need to fully understand how to wire them all the bits together. If time permits, also in the micropub realm, I want to get mobile publishing set up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GitHub is My View Source</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started learning web development in earnest, (beyond basic HTML), the community college I was attending was still teaching Dreamweaver as de facto method of building a site and using Photoshop and tables based layouts. Meanwhile I had launched my first blog with WordPress, fresh off the 1.5 release that brought full themes, XHTML and CSS. Reading blog posts on the subjects was basically the way I learned those skills. And viewing the page source of the authors writing those posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2016, and I still view source. More often than not now, I‚Äôm learning from GitHub repositories. Which is why finding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree&quot;&gt;Octotree&lt;/a&gt; browser plugin was such a find. Rather than having to navigate back and forth inside a repo, you get a tree view of the files to the left of the browser window. If you find your self using the back button and navigating breadcrumbs, I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Couch to 5k - Day 3 Week 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First week (well, 3 runs) in the book. Lesson learned today is take the little twinges of discomfort serious. I had minor discomfort in my right ankle but pushed through, and am now feeling that I was compensating for it. I may need to wait until Friday to start the next week, but that‚Äôs to be determined. Consider me day-to-day on the injury report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other take away from today was, despite being a native Floridian, it‚Äôs easy to forget the seriousness humidity contributes to the &lt;em&gt;feels like&lt;/em&gt; temperature. I may want to start timing my runs for morning, or later in the evening (though the summer weather patterns might not play nice with evening runs in general.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distance: 1.75 mi&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pace: 11:29 min/mi&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Couch to 5k - Day 2 Week 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This evening I completed day 2 of the first week of couch to 5k. As exhilarating as day one was, I was equally sore the next day. Though I try to walk a little every day, there are muscles you use to jog that don‚Äôt come into play walking. That said, I wasn‚Äôt deterred, and today was my planned day 2. The schedule is 3 days a week for the first 3 weeks at least, I didn‚Äôt look beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I did learn from day one was to not push the jog too hard to start, and was able to pace myself a bit better today. I also tried to zig-zag around the neighborhood rather than do laps around the small park near my house. The laps felt a bit too monotonous, as I was checking the app to gauge progress. Snaking through the neighborhood didn‚Äôt feel that way. It may have slowed me a bit as I didn‚Äôt have a route planned, but the app maps the run so I can check back and have a clearer idea of what would be a good loop. Speaking of, on my geek side, I‚Äôm looking at ways to export the .gpx file and create a static map of the run and post with these posts, much like the static map I created with my Instagram photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distance: 1.69 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pace: 11:46 min/mi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Extraneous Whitespace in Jekyll HTML</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One artifact of Jekyll that has bothered me is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/1717&quot;&gt;redundant blank lines&lt;/a&gt; in the rendered HTML. In my case, I was seeing hundreds of blank lines creating the page navigation at the top of the page. It doesn‚Äôt affect what the visitor sees, but for developers who use Jekyll poor source is a bad practice. Also imagine someone new to Jekyll and HTML in general trying to view source to debug an issue. Turns out the problem is with the Liquid template language Jekyll uses. Seems the Liquid community have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/216&quot;&gt;discussing the issue&lt;/a&gt; for 3 years without a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first approach to solving this was to use a Ruby gem &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier&quot;&gt;HTML Beautifier&lt;/a&gt;. It works great, but for a site like mine with over 500 posts with a lot of tag pages, it increases the build time exponentially. To the point I‚Äôve seen Travis time out due to the long process. Today I went looking for another solution and stumbled upon this &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kerotaa/5788650&quot;&gt;gist - remove empty lines&lt;/a&gt;. It concerned me the plugin would increase the build time in Jekyll vs in Travis, but was pleasantly surprised it added no noticeable overhead and produces much cleaner HTML output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I get quick build times and cleaner source.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Couch to 5k - Day 1 Week 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been telling myself all year that I was going to start this, but my body was telling me something else. Today that changed. It was just day 1, walking for 12 minutes, jogging for 8, but it feels perfect and I can‚Äôt wait for day 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distance 1.6 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pace 12:29 min/mi&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Housekeeping May 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Figure for my own reference I should document the updates I‚Äôve made to the site the last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve written before that my primary goal with the reboot of this site is to embrace IndieWeb. The first step was &lt;a href=&quot;https://miklb.com/finally-webmentons-with-jekyll-part-duex&quot;&gt;receiving webmentions&lt;/a&gt;, then sending them. Also in the process I, started an indiewebified &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb&quot;&gt;Jekyll theme&lt;/a&gt; (which I‚Äôm using on this site at the time of writing.) Part of that was to have better microformats in the markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big itch that I wanted to scratch was implementing micropub to free myself from Twitter (something I‚Äôve failed at thus far). With the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://voxpelli.com/2016/03/my-2015-in-indieweb/&quot;&gt;Pelle Wessman&lt;/a&gt; who shared n bit of yet to be public ‚Äúglue‚Äù to pull together his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voxpelli/node-micropub-express&quot;&gt;other tools&lt;/a&gt;, I set up my own micropub endpoint on a Heroku.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  I still need to workout adding a syndication endpoint for Twitter so I can auto-tweet notes, but that is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that was in place, I was able to use the tools &lt;a href=&quot;https://aaronparecki.com&quot;&gt;Aaron Perecki&lt;/a&gt; built, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quill.p3k.io&quot;&gt;Quill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quill.p3k.io&quot;&gt;OwnYourGram&lt;/a&gt;. Quill is a web based micropub publishing app, and OwnYourGram is a service that helps you &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/pesos&quot;&gt;PESOS&lt;/a&gt; your Instagram photos to your own site&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the experiments I‚Äôve been doing here might be overkill for a simple blog, but are great ways to expose myself to new technologies. I‚Äôve long had an Amazon Web Services s3 bucket set up as a CDN, but had never found a workflow to efficiently use it. With the my current build/deploy process with Travis, a copy of the Instagram photo is saved to my GitHub repository via micropub. In the build script, the image is copied to the s3 bucket, then linked to the CDN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary reason to use the CDN was I went through the steps to get 100% on Google Pagespeed (last I checked). Since the site is primarily text and is already static it ranked pretty well, but I went ahead and configured loading critical CSS&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. (I had set that up with my old Habari theme, but Google‚Äôs added a step to async load the remaining CSS). I also had to tweak caching in nginx, which while I was in there, I went ahead and set up http/2. The primary reason I moved back from GitHub pages to my VPS was to serve the site over https with a free LetsEncrypt SSL certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I went back and forth on analytics. I don‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; them, but it‚Äôs nice to see what visitors are looking for and at. I poked around at some self hosted options, ultimately decided for now that for the people who don‚Äôt want to share data with Google, there are browser tools to block sending the data, which I‚Äôm OK with, therefore using GA here isn‚Äôt forcing anyone into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still want to do a fresh design, but only after last few kinks in Jekyll-IndieWeb theme are fixed. I‚Äôll still use the markup as the foundation, just present it differently. As always, if you have any questions, hit me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miklb&quot;&gt;@miklb&lt;/a&gt; or leave a webmention and I‚Äôll do my best to reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brid.gy/publish/twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which was my first experience with both Heroku as well as a node app. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Instagram has locked you out of pushing your images from your own site to Instagram. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The command line tool in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/filamentgroup/criticalCSS&quot;&gt;Filament Group‚Äôs CriticalCSS tool&lt;/a&gt; made that pretty trivial. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Free Resource: Combining Type</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the few design skills I would truly like to fully understand and be able to employ in my work is the ability to choose and use type properly. Tonight I stumbled upon a post on the TypeKit blog sharing a pdf of a previously for sale book on the subject. While it is unfortunate that publisher didn‚Äôt succeed, it is generous of the author to share it with the public. Head over to the blog to get a digital copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.typekit.com/2016/04/29/combining-typefaces-free-guide-to-great-typography/&quot;&gt;Pocket Guide to Combining Typefaces&lt;/a&gt;. If you have other resources, please send them my way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Organizing Jekyll Posts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Until last night, I was under the impression you had to store all of your posts as markdown files in a single directory called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; unless you changed that in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file (and even then, my assumption was it was still a single directory.) That said, I still sought out whether there was a way to organize them by at least year within that single folder. I‚Äôve been blogging for 11 years this spring, and while sporadic at times, that is still a lot of posts. When I need to reference a new one, or look for something from the past, having them by year would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr yes, you can arbitrarily organize under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; folder however you want. All Jekyll looks for are markdown files with FrontMatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I also learned, and isn‚Äôt &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is that you can create top level folders each with their own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; sub-folder and Jekyll will read from each one, appending that folder name to the generated url for the post, i.e. a folder &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2016-04-26-post-title&lt;/code&gt; would yield a URL of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com/foo/post-title&lt;/code&gt; (varying by your permalink structure). Those top level folders are then treated as categories, allowing for more filtration within your templates and site organization. I can see other ways of using them, especially as I continue to move towards a more Indieweb way of doing things and more tweets originating from this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to contribute my discoveries to the official documentation as soon as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brid.gy/publish/twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hint: it‚Äôs hidden under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page.categories&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Productivity Status Early 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I broke one of my new rules today by tweeting out more than politics snark or sports and briefly outlined the direction I‚Äôm moving with my &lt;em&gt;productivity&lt;/em&gt; this year. I‚Äôve been toiling the past year or so trying to shoehorn my brain into Omnifocus to no avail, so at the beginning of the year I started exploring other methods. About 2 weeks ago, my brain just started to work in regard to using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taskpaper.com&quot;&gt;TaskPaper&lt;/a&gt;. If you aren‚Äôt familiar with TaskPaper, it is a plain text method of tracking todos that has tools built around it to filter by tags and projects. I‚Äôve owned the app for awhile, but not until 3.0 was in beta did things begin to click within the app organizing projects. I always wanted (wrongly) to keep separate files for each project. Maybe that is one thing I learned using Omnifocus was structuring projects. Now everything personal is one single text file. I do have a separate one for the free lance work I‚Äôm doing because that‚Äôs a different mode. I don‚Äôt want to be distracted by anything when I‚Äôm trying to mow through items for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other element of my productivity was how to keep and better use Reminders.app and Siri. I knew TaskPaper had Applescript support, so that was the first place I looked. Sure enough, I found a script that would import from Reminders to TaskPaper. Unfortunately, TP3 changed it‚Äôs scripting method to new JXA, so the old Applescripts were not compatible. Luckily, someone did the work before I fried synapses trying to learn more advanced methods of JXA. A thread in the support forums,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/appending-items-to-a-taskpaper-file-using-siri/1456/9&quot;&gt;Using Siri&lt;/a&gt; covered exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, I devised the idea of having an ‚ÄúInbox‚Äù for Siri and a corresponding list for TP. I also have a Grocery List and my main reminders is for timed items. I prefer Apple‚Äôs reminders because it‚Äôs nag is truly a nag. If something &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be done on a certain day, it will sit on the lock screen of my phone. I can snooze it for an hour if it‚Äôs not time sensitive, and if it really can wait, I can put off until next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can say, ‚ÄúHey, Siri, add build a robot to my inbox‚Äù and she will. Later, I can run the script which will migrate (including deleting) the reminder to an Inbox in TaskPaper, which I can move to an appropriate project or create a new one if it is warranted. My next goal is to set up a cron job on the always-on iMac to run the script every night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For iOS, I‚Äôve tried a few different apps for TaskPaper, but it seems &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?at=10lKmy&quot;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt; is going to stick. Also, I‚Äôve not given up on Omnifocus for long term project tracking or potentially work related where contexts and due dates might be necessary, something OF excels at. An upcoming update to &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?at=10lKmy&quot;&gt;Omnifocus for iOS&lt;/a&gt; will vastly expand on the URL schemes, and there is already a demo using &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?at=10lKmy&quot;&gt;WorkFlow&lt;/a&gt; to build projects in OF from TaskPaper formatted lists in Editorial. Sounds snazzy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all my new system isn‚Äôt that fancy or original, but again, that‚Äôs the trap of chasing productivity, apps and systems. They become complicated and burdensome to the point you abandon them for the next shiny object, never truly doing the stuff you really wanted to keep track of in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope when I visit this in the fall, I‚Äôve not made many changes and can focus on what I‚Äôve accomplished over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Performance is a Feature</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent last evening making the necessary tweaks to this site to get a perfect 100% score on Google‚Äôs
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/&quot;&gt;Pagespeed Insights&lt;/a&gt;. I understand this is just a personal site, but at the root,understanding how to make this site fast will translate to helping bigger projects keep an eye out for potential bottle necks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why when Aaron Gustafson &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson/status/724448660076027904&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; this posts headline, it caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Either way, you could do much worse than to make your bit of the web fast.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://peterchamberlin.com/fast.php&quot;&gt;Peter Chamberlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context was more broad and I believe directed towards larger sites, but it has to start somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I plan on sharing how I implemented the changes to get to 100%, specifically the critical CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Customizing Atom Editor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I doubt anyone who writes code for a living or tinkers for that matter hasn‚Äôt spent more hours than they‚Äôd care to admit tweaking their editor of choice. Suffice to say, I‚Äôm in that boat all to well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current editor of choice is &lt;a href=&quot;http://atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs open source and more than fits the customization itch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from deciding on which packages to use (I‚Äôve
&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/users/miklb/stars&quot;&gt;starred the ones I use&lt;/a&gt;) the other element I‚Äôve gone back and forth with is theme &amp;amp; syntax UI. I‚Äôve long been a fan of both Solarized Light and Dark, but have finally settled on Atom Dark and &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/themes/oceanic-next&quot;&gt;Oceanic Next&lt;/a&gt;. I can also recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://olivermak.es&quot;&gt;Oliver Pattison‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/users/opattison&quot;&gt;Newbound syntax themes&lt;/a&gt; My dream font is Operator Mono, but until I can justify the purchase of that, I‚Äôm using &lt;a href=&quot;http://input.fontbureau.com/info/&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tweak I just discovered is for adjusting the font size in the panel, or the sidebar. I‚Äôd been able to easily make the font larger for code/markdown, but sometimes had to break the readers out to discern what file was what in a nested folder. To the rescue I found &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;atom-panel.tool-panel&lt;/code&gt; for just that. I‚Äôm currently using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.4em&lt;/code&gt;. Mind you this is on my old 11 inch Air. I‚Äôve not had as much an issue on the iMac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tweak I‚Äôve added to my custom &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;styles.less&lt;/code&gt; file is to italicize attributes. I‚Äôm also a fan of italicized comment blocks, which is included in the snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sass highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;atom-text-editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.entity.other.attribute-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.comment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure as I expand my development world, (I have a goal to learn python by &lt;a href=&quot;https://miklb.com/building-a-twitterbot&quot;&gt;Building a Twitterbot&lt;/a&gt; ) I‚Äôll continue to tweak Atom, but for now, I‚Äôm as close to happy with an editor as I have ever been. Feel free to share with me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miklb&quot;&gt;@miklb&lt;/a&gt; your tips and trick.

        <title>Interest in Tampa Homebrew Website Club?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gauging interest in Tampa to see if anyone would be up for joining a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://indiewebcamp.com/events/2016-04-06-homebrew-website-club&quot;&gt;Homebrew Website Club&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of tech folks have vey neglected personal sites and this would give folks a chance to get together and talk tech and work on their personal site and pet proejcts. Platform agnostic (read, not another WordPress meetup) so open to anyone. If interested ping me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miklb&quot;&gt;Twitter @miklb&lt;/a&gt; for now and I‚Äôll sort out finding a location and setting up a time. Only looking for a couple of people to get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Headings - What Was Old is New Again</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Seems HTML WG has reversed course on a previous recommendation that allowed &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sections&lt;/code&gt; to have their own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;H1&lt;/code&gt; tag, now recommending the previous norm of cascading H tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Given that this bug has been around, and not fixed in browsers, for many  
years, we are proposing to remove the suggestion, and return to the model  
where elements `h1..h6` have a defined level of their own.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2016Apr/0032.html&quot;&gt;HTML WG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

        <title>Dogfooding</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I switched over the &lt;em&gt;theme&lt;/em&gt; for this site to a project I‚Äôve been working on the last moth or so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb&quot;&gt;Jekyll-IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt;. While I have different design ideas, until I find other users interested in using it, I knew I needed to work out any kinks. I also wanted to have better microformat support until the design changes. Thus
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food&quot;&gt;dogfooding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will write more about the project once I have more documentation (and work out any more said kinks), but the gist is I wanted to provide someone new to Jekyll with a desire to be part of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://indiewebcamp.com/&quot;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; a solid starting point. I rely heavily on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file for options a user can set - profile pic, social media links, choice to include display of webmentions - to quickly get a personal site up and running. The biggest hurdle for me was providing a minimal design that was unopinionated yet still aesthetically appealing. Anyone familiar with HTML &amp;amp; CSS can easily build upon or modify it, but if not, it shouldn‚Äôt look &lt;em&gt;ugly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been the first solo project I‚Äôve embarked on that was meant for public consumption from the start, which in itself has been a learning process. Now I just hope others can find it useful in some way. If the project interests you I encourage you to try it out, open any issues in the repo, or reach out on #indiewebcamp IRC, I tend to hang around there most days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rough Take on Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a longer discussion about the recent pitch by Medium to content creators to move to their platform and options for new companies to build a site on, this nugget on whether Jekyll is an option:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Only usable by developers. About as accessible as improv Klingon slam poetry to anybody else.

        <title>Solving the Mysterious Relaunching iTunes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been plagued by an issue on my Macbook Air the last couple of months where iTunes would relaunch mysteriously. Not random relaunch mysteriously, more like, as soon as I quit, it would relaunch. I tried force quit and restarts. I trashed cache files and rebuilt the library to no avail. I filed bug reports and feedback to iTunes. Finally I reached out to @AppleSupport on Twitter. Right after (mind you, I DM‚Äôed the account as they asked and so far no further reply) my internet friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shep&quot;&gt;@shep&lt;/a&gt; linked to a blog post of his from 4 years ago with his own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iamshep.net/2012/08/the-never-ending-saga-of-itunes-launching-itself/&quot;&gt;saga of iTunes relaunching&lt;/a&gt;. I read through, and while I didn‚Äôt have headphones plugged in, I have dozed off a few times with my headphones in, and maybe, as he read about the microswitch in the jack, maybe, just maybe the headphones pulled out slightly &amp;amp; not depressing said microswitch. So I forcefully inserted some headphones and quickly pulled the plug out of the jack. I quit iTunes and &lt;em&gt;so far&lt;/em&gt;, iTunes hasn‚Äôt relaunched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention @AppleSupport hasn‚Äôt followed up yet?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building a Twitterbot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interest to learn the programming language python for quite some time. I‚Äôve played around with it a little using &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista/id528579881?at=10lKmy&quot;&gt;Pythonista&lt;/a&gt; in iOS to &lt;a href=&quot;https://miklb.com/use-pythonista-to-get-weather-of-current-location-into-drafts-app&quot;&gt;build a fishing log&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise have only done some cursory reading. Since I do best learning by doing, I needed an idea to &lt;strong&gt;use&lt;/strong&gt; python. I‚Äôve seen some interesting Twitterbots built with it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pomological&quot;&gt;@pomological&lt;/a&gt; being my recent favorite, but wasn‚Äôt sure what to build. Ultimately, the idea came to me to build a bot that retrieves an image from Flickr and builds a color scheme from that and post the scheme and original image. I‚Äôve done some basic research and found some libraries to connect (you didn‚Äôt think I was going to write the whole thing from scratch?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don‚Äôt just want a any random image, so once I get the bot &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt;, I want to be able to try and pull outdoor/landscape images. In a perfect world, I would post 3 images a day‚Äîmorning, noon, and night. The morning image would be a sunrise, noon/daytime image a normal image and, you guessed it, the night/evening image would be a sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured I needed a name for the Twitterbot, not only to make sure something would be available, but since I would need API keys, that has been my first tangible step to create the bot. Thus, @Flickolorbot has been officially conceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few Thoughts About WordPress REST API and Core</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been much written about the ~drama~ discussions surrounding the &lt;a href=&quot;http://v2.wp-api.org&quot;&gt;WordPress REST API&lt;/a&gt; and inclusion in core. Or exclusion, depending on who‚Äôs take you are reading. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Suffice to say, the gist I‚Äôve gathered is that there are two competing perspectives, one side wants to incrementally add the API, the other wants a fully fleshed out, complete API before inclusion in core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my 2¬¢ on the matter is this‚Äîthe core tenet of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is ‚Äúto democratize publishing through Open Source, GPL software.‚Äù From what I‚Äôve gathered reading on the subject, the REST API team have the publishing portion of the API covered and ready for inclusion in core. The parts that would come (much) later would be things like the customizer, file editing, more site &lt;strong&gt;management&lt;/strong&gt; tools, less about actually publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If democratized publishing is still the guiding principle for WordPress the project, then I don‚Äôt see how there is any debate. Opening up the methods to publish beyond what has been the only means available for basically the entire life of the project seems like a no brainer to this guy who‚Äôs been around it for 11 years this year. No one will truly know how much is opened up until it is in the hands of creative developers and then in the hands of content creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brid.gy/publish/twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm specifically not linking to any of the &lt;em&gt;hot takes&lt;/em&gt; on the subject. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Text Expander snippet for Jekyll With Slug for Permalink</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of TextExpander snippets floating around for creating Jekyll Front Matter, however, I wanted to take it a step further, and auto-create a slugified permalink with no additional work. The other part of the equation was that I wanted it to be able to use it on TE touch, which meant it had to be done in javascript. After a little Googling, some trial and error, I came up with one that takes a text input for the post title, generates a slug from that, and includes the current date. I understand that the date in the file can be used, however I may not always publish when the file was initially created. Not to mention, when I imported all of my posts from Habari, I needed to be able to use the original post date, not the date the file was created, so I continue to use that. You can certainly modify the snippet for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note, I have a blank variable for &lt;em&gt;summary&lt;/em&gt;. Since I‚Äôm using webmentions, I use the summary as the text for a tweet, which would be different than an excerpt. Some of this may change when I redo the site redesign, but for now, it‚Äôs how I roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love feedback on how to make the snippet better as it‚Äôs my first javascript snippet. Just leave a comment on the gist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;var title = &amp;#39;%filltext:name=Title%&amp;#39;;
slug = title.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, &amp;#39;&amp;#39;);
var newslug = title.split(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;).join(&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;);

var dt = new Date();

TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;---\n&amp;quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;layout: post \n&amp;quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;title: &amp;quot; + &amp;#39;&amp;quot;&amp;#39; +title + &amp;#39;&amp;quot;&amp;#39;+ &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;tags: \n&amp;quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;published: true \n&amp;quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;permalink: &amp;quot;) +TextExpander.appendOutput(newslug.toLowerCase()); + TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;date: &amp;quot;) + TextExpander.appendOutput(dt.getFullYear() + &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; +(dt.getMonth() +1) + &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; + dt.getDate()) + TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;summary: \n&amp;quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&amp;quot;--- \n&amp;quot;);

// %filltop%&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;

        <title>First Listen: Luther Dickinson</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Garden &amp;amp; Gun&lt;/cite&gt; have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gardenandgun.com/blog/first-listen-luther-dickinson-blues-ballads&quot;&gt;first listen of Luther Dickinson‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; solo album &lt;cite&gt;Blues &amp;amp; Ballads.&lt;/cite&gt; If you‚Äôre not familiar with Dickinson, he was a founding member of the band North Missippi All-Stars, a raucous blues band hailing from their name sake Mississippi. Founded with his brother, they played a modern version of the blues soaked southern rock, with an emphasis on the former. I had the pleasure of seeing them both in a smaller outdoor club setting as well as a larger festival type setting, both times blowing the doors off the crowd. Not sure his vocals will ever be considered above average, but the accompanying vocals from the likes of Mavis Staples balances it out. The lyrics and guitars more than make up for his singing, and its obvious the apple didn‚Äôt fall from the tree, as you can tell he knows his way around the studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As first listens go, I‚Äôm enjoying it and will certainly be added to the rotation the next week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Focused Blogs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my ever revolving attempt to reboot my blog, one thing that has always slowed me down was my concern with being too esoteric in my topics. I want to talk about food, technology and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if I want to build any readership (isn‚Äôt that a part of blogging, sharing your thoughts with others?) I can‚Äôt be mixing in posts about forays into Python with posts about cooking vegetables sous-vide. Sure, there might be a readership that is interested in both topics as I am, but not enough to say ‚Äúscrew it.‚Äù So as I continue to work towards a true &lt;a href=&quot;https://indiewebcamp.com&quot;&gt;indieweb&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôm pivoting a bit in my approach and will use this as domain, now 11 years old, as my base identifier and central clearing house. I‚Äôve acquired several domains, 2 of which will be good to split the topics. Those too will be static Jekyll built sites, with links from this site to new posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly this is more me thinking out loud and putting it out there, as I intend for this domain to be, but my goal is to continue to do such here, rather than bottle  up my thoughts in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brid.gy/publish/twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Finally Webmentions with Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you can‚Äôt tell by previous posts, I‚Äôve been working on getting
&lt;a href=&quot;https://indiewebcamp.com/Webmention&quot;&gt;Webmentions&lt;/a&gt; to work with my new Jekyll site. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôve finally nailed. If you take a look at my initial post &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/making-the-move-to-jekyll&quot;&gt;on moving to Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, there‚Äôs a link for a tutorial on using Travis CI to build a branch and move the flat files into the mater branch to be served on GitHub. With the help of a Aaron Gustafson‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io&quot;&gt;Webmention.io plugin&lt;/a&gt; I finally have it working. The trick was that the rakefile was firing in the build process too fast, so webmention.io couldn‚Äôt find the post on my domain, thus not sending the mention. My probably not so elegant solution was to put a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sleep 2m&lt;/code&gt; in my shell script to slow things down and let GitHub catchup before firing the rakefile and sending the mentions. This post will be my final test. If all goes well, I will try and write up a more detailed explanation of what I‚Äôve done since there‚Äôs still a lot missing for doing this with a Jekyll site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breaking Out of the Silo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my never ending quest to make this site all things ‚Äúmiklb‚Äù, one of the goals of the IndieWeb is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE&quot;&gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt;, that is, Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere. Breaking the habit of using Twitter without posting first on my site is going to be a hard one, but it‚Äôs a goal. While debates rage about extending character counts to 10,000 words, if we only were to use our blog for long form thoughts and link back to Twitter, this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Consider this an exercise in&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making the Move to Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve officially made the change from Habari to Jekyll. I will certainly have more to share on the move, both a post-mortem on Habari, as well as the process I‚Äôm using currently for using Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic workflow currently is serving the page from GitHub pages, however I‚Äôm using Travis CI to build the site and  publish to master branch&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; , there by bypassing the restrictions of gh-pages (specifically, their need for using ‚Äìsafe mode and not up-to-date version of Jekyll). Currently my use case would probably work within their parameters, however I had already started using 3.x and at the time of writing GitHub is using 2.x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly to me, I want to be able to blog from my phone. It something that I feel has limited me in sharing interesting items I come across as well as stopping me from making time to put thoughts down as they come. I had originally wrote up &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/first-thoughts-holy-grail-of-blogging-from-ios-with-jekyll&quot;&gt;some thoughts on using iOS and Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, but later came across a better workflow&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are still some wonkiness around, I‚Äôm sure my Atom feed is broken and am not sure how to redirect that yet using GitHub. I doubt I had many subscribers, so if you stumble on this and previously read my random posts, you may need to update while I investigate options. Certainly there are some styling issues that I want to address as well as some under the hood improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://eshepelyuk.github.io/2014/10/28/automate-github-pages-travisci.html&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; was an invaluable starting point. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://mlota.github.io/2015/11/23/automating-deployment-github-pages-jekyll-travis.html&quot;&gt;follow up tutorial from the comments&lt;/a&gt; has great information as well. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since I already own Drafts, Workflow and Working Copy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matteocappadonna.org/Posting-with-Drafts,-Working-Copy-and-Workflow&quot;&gt;integrating all 3&lt;/a&gt; makes sense. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embracing My Suckiness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some know I used to cook for a living. I‚Äôd like to think I was pretty good at it too. I started before the Food Network and all the other cooking shows on TV (save for old Julia Childs and Jacques Pepin shows on PBS and the like), before the internet blew up. Cooking in Tampa was almost like being in a vacuum.  You‚Äôd see what your peers were doing, maybe find a little time to travel to Miami or New Orleans, but otherwise, we were left to our own curiosity, a few books from some of the chefs on the cutting edge (Mark Miller and the staff at Coyote Cafe, Norma Van Aiken and his contemporaries like Allen Susser &amp;amp; Mark Militello) and the occasional &lt;em&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/em&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explored other cuisines via ethnic dining, scoured Oceanic Market for Asian ingredients, the markets of West Tampa for authentic Latin/Caribbean staples, and the open air markets outside the commercial produce market. We were then left to our imagination, creativity, and abilities to marry flavors together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was kinda like how it was when I first started building websites. You‚Äôd look at someone‚Äôs source code. Someone might have written a blog post, or shared a tip in a forum somewhere. You bought Zeldman‚Äôs book on HTML standards, or Andy Budd‚Äôs CSS Mastery. It was a path of discovery and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in this ‚Äúage of information‚Äù, we (I), am bombarded with all of the latest tricks and best practices, cutting edge designs and techniques.  The external pressure to live up to these can be overwhelming. I‚Äôm no longer experimenting and discovering on my own, I‚Äôm drowning in information. It‚Äôs like having an elevator straight to the top of the mountain without experiencing the journey (I think that‚Äôs a paraphrase of something I read once about doing LSD, but I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I‚Äôm finding is that I‚Äôm a deer in the headlights, afraid that I‚Äôll be judged for not using the latest markup techniques. That someone will see my code and think I suck. And rather than embrace my suckiness, learn from it, I freeze. I stare at blank pages in my text editor. Meanwhile, new and more information continues to bombard me from every angle, and the cycle perpetuates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, when I cook at home, I‚Äôm not worried about having all the fancy ingredients or flashy sous vide machine. I‚Äôm confident in my skills and &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; the finished dish will look appetizing and taste better. Or, I might &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; miss the mark, but will recognize what I did wrong or forgot, storing it away in my memory bank or nowadays, jotted into a text file for the next time I make a similar dish. That‚Äôs not to say when time permits I don‚Äôt use those fancy ingredients or make my pasta from scratch but a good meal shouldn‚Äôt be passed up simply because I didn‚Äôt have artisanal cheese and didn‚Äôt make my pasta from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I struggle to reboot my personal site and convert it to Jekyll, I need to recognize that I don‚Äôt have to follow every new trend. So what if it wasn‚Äôt built in Sass. The work I put into making it responsive, and FAST is more important in the long run. There are plenty of sites/devs out there that have well structured Sass directories and all the right mixins, but load slow as hell. There is plenty of time in the future to revisit converting it. The end goal for this site isn‚Äôt about being a Sass master, but an outlet to share my thoughts and experiences on the web. Why create an artificial hurdle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which also means I need to document my failures, as well as successes. Whether that means publicly, or internally. Not only document them, but celebrate them. I need to reconnect with that ambitious kid who would spend every waking hour in the kitchen experimenting, enjoying the journey. Thus starts my journey of documenting this phase of my site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Web Ad Dilemma</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been thinking about this subject quite a bit lately. While tools like Safari‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Reader View&lt;/em&gt; can help, the desire to support advertising on the web is impossible to square with the current implementation on most web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jimray&quot;&gt;Jim Ray&lt;/a&gt; breaks it down much more succinctly than I have been able to. &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickerfusion.com/blocking-ad-blockers-with-better-ads.html&quot;&gt;Blocking ad-blockers with better ads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem may be murky, but the solution is a bit more clear, if not exactly novel: build a better product. Not a fancier iPad app, a better ad product. For all the haranguing about native ads, they have the advantage of being immune to filters and, when done right, a genuinely better experience, certainly better than green double-underlines or the ‚Äúcontent marketing platform‚Äù ads at the bottom of far too many web¬†pages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just give me a well designed, compelling advertisement. Hell, I‚Äôll share my browsing history if that is what it takes to serve me something I‚Äôm genuinely interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This band just rocks me. I can not wait for the whole record. God knows what bands they listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Albini, do your homework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixies? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nirvana? Had to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bands I missed out when I was doing stuff? I want to know them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, more music like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kq3rNIYUwU0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That bass line. Be still the 23 year old still in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Thoughts: Holy Grail of Blogging from iOS with Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been researching and thinking seriously about moving away from database driven blog engines to &lt;em&gt;static file&lt;/em&gt; blogging for quite awhile. My extensive research has me convinced for my ideal workflow, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; will be the answer‚Äîexcept for my goal to somewhat easily blog from my phone. All of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot;&gt;front matter&lt;/a&gt; could be handled by TextExpander snippets or custom keyboard shortcuts in Drafts or Editorial. The issue has been that with an iOS device, you are basically confined to using Dropbox or iCloud for the text/markdown files. Wanting to keep everything in a Git repo under version control, I hadn‚Äôt found a way to automagically push a Dropbox file to a Git repo without having an always on machine at home using some listening app like &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot;&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt; to do this. While that isn‚Äôt out of the question, I want something &lt;strong&gt;straight from the device&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensive Googling finally led me to Zappier. Similar to IFTTT, they have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/zapbook/dropbox/github/&quot;&gt;Github/Dropbox workflow&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to send a pull request to Github when a new file is added to a directory in Dropbox. And while if I was simply using Github pages to host a Jekyll site, that would be the end to a simple solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I still want to host my own data on my own VPS (more on that later). Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/developmentseed/jekyll-hook&quot;&gt;Jekyll Hook&lt;/a&gt;, which, while not seemingly for the faint of heart, allows one to run their own ‚ÄúGithub Pages‚Äù on their own server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while all untested at this point, on paper it seems I can have a dedicated Dropbox folder synced with an iOS editor that when a markdown file is saved to it, Zapier will attempt to send a pull request and merge it to a Github hosted repo of my blog [footnote, possibly need to have iOS app to approve pull request but option is in the &lt;em&gt;recipe&lt;/em&gt; for the workflow. I assume it will work save for any previous files by same name causing a merge conflict]. From that, the Jekyll Hook script/solution will fire and rebuild the the site, all without leaving the convenience of my iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential magic I tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Email is so 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;tl;dr Wouldn't it be nice if in the newfound popularity of email newsletters, the signup form had an option &quot;I regularly consume your content via another means, but would love to win your cool thing&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the dark days of the internet, websites would have simple sign up forms for users to get updates about the site. Unless you used RSS (or Atom) to read the sites. Even then, online marketers and brands would offer specials not advertised on their site to build the engagement via email. The size of your mailing list was a badge of honor for those marketers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came along social media, and email lists were pushed aside for the shiny new thing. In the beginning, there was a glut of social media options, and it was almost impossible for a brand to engage on &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; outlet. Facebook likes and Twitter followers became the new badge of honor. And while social media is still a great way to engage users, brands and marketers soon discovered they couldn‚Äôt always control the message, especially with Facebook. So what did they do? They realized the most common form of communication available to the web is the venerable method of email. &lt;em&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/em&gt; was a perfect example. I couldn‚Äôt count the number of comments I read on Twitter about people weeding their email of offers from long ago forgotten sites. But I mostly follow web professionals who know the ins-and-outs of online marketing and get their information from, (well, probably Twitter, but they are an anomalous subset of the Twittersphere.) The point being, millions of people woke to an inbox of offers. Many people clicked those links, some bought stuff. It works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn.miklb.com/images/wirecutter_form.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sign up form for The Wirecutter&quot; /&gt;RSS/Atom syndication in its purest form is not a common method of reading websites today (unless you are part of the aforementioned anomalous subset of Twitter users), but still provides the backbone of many ways content is consumed. But this isn‚Äôt about syndication. It is about the rebirth of mailing lists, and more specifically, the forms that sites now deploy to get you in. Those lists sign-ups are generally there year round, but right about the holiday season, sites/brands begin offering ‚Äúfree stuff.‚Äù Be it a book, a song or a full suite of electronics, sign up for their mailing list, enter a chance to win. I‚Äôm not an expert on this subject, didn‚Äôt even play an email marketer on TV. &lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn.miklb.com/images/seriouseats_form.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sign up form for The Wirecutter&quot; /&gt;But my understanding is you can‚Äôt force people into subscribing, just like contests have the small disclaimer, ‚Äúno purchase necessary.‚Äù Generally what these forms do is pre-populate the subscribe checkbox, which is still a slippery slope in my opinion of conforming to the spirit of opting in. But hey, a free TV is a free TV?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to the point, there is never an option (at least one I‚Äôve encountered) that says, ‚ÄúI love your content and regularly read it so I don‚Äôt need an email reminder. However, I‚Äôd love to win your cool stuff.‚Äù Hell, provide a short text box to allow the user to optionally add &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; they consume it. It very well might be a great insight into your audience and their online consumption habits. Because at some point, inundating your readers/consumers will call into play the law of diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I‚Äôm afraid the new badge of honor is the hydra of social media followers guarding the treasure chest of email subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Engaging Users Vs. Advertising</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve seen the headline bandied about in social media all week, but over on &lt;cite&gt;Unapologetic&lt;/cite&gt; Alex Guyot discusses his disagreement with &lt;a href=&quot;http://unapologetic.io/posts/2014/11/14/facebook-makes-it-harder-again-for-brands-to-advertise-for-free/&quot;&gt;Facebook making it harder (again) for brands to advertise for free.&lt;/a&gt;. His basic argument is that brands most likely already bought the likes and shouldn‚Äôt have to pay to advertise again to those same customers. He also uses the argument that small businesses likely can‚Äôt afford to advertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn‚Äôt disagree more with his take. From the Re/code article of the same name &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the author quotes the Facebook release&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The company announced today it will begin limiting the number of ‚Äúpromotional Page posts‚Äù in the News Feed starting in January. That means you‚Äôll see fewer posts from brands asking you to buy products or ‚Äúenter promotions and sweepstakes,‚Äù Facebook wrote in a blog post.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see no issue with that statement. While we all know we are the product on Facebook &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I still use it to keep up with family and friends, as well as local goings on. I have ‚Äúliked‚Äù very few &lt;em&gt;brands&lt;/em&gt;, mostly local businesses. Truthfully, those local businesses don‚Äôt use what I would consider ‚Äúpromotions or sweepstakes‚Äù or obvious ad-like updates. They are genuinely engaging their followers. Sharing pics of a new dish. Updating on what band or artist is appearing soon. They respond to questions and comments. As you should in social media. So if cutting down on the noise from million plus ‚Äúfan‚Äù businesses in timelines so that the news feed is a truly a ‚Äúnews‚Äù feed with targeted ads, and people don‚Äôt miss the latest update from the mom &amp;amp; pop shop down the street, I‚Äôm all for it. It is well documented that brands and businesses that truly engage their users/followers are the most successful. Perhaps this will push those brands to up their game. Otherwise, it can be a great equalizer for brands and companies looking to gain market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

        <title>Technology Fatigue</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A piece at &lt;cite&gt;A List Apart&lt;/cite&gt; today struck a nerve with a lot of developers today, myself included (if I can really call myself a developer these days.) &lt;a href=&quot;http://alistapart.com/blog/post/overwhelmed-by-code&quot;&gt;Overwhelmed by Code&lt;/a&gt; touches on the constant bombardment to developers from new technologies popping up seemingly daily. The author discusses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It used to be that knowing CSS and HTML was enough, then jQuery came along, then responsive techniques, then Node.js and then Angular, Ember, etc., etc., etc. That list, right there, it tires me out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that I can completely relate. When I stumbled into making websites, they were still teaching how to use Photoshop and tables to build sites at my local community college, not pure CSS. The big revelation at &lt;cite&gt;A List Apart&lt;/cite&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alistapart.com/article/fauxcolumns&quot;&gt;Faux Columns&lt;/a&gt;. So fast forward 10 years, take a sabbatical for 2 of those, and you can imagine how overwhelming stepping back into grunt, gulp, coffee script, node and Luce&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;What do I want to focus on, what do I love about the web? What do I actually want to learn, versus what I think I should learn. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I am to do more than dip my toes back into the world of building websites, I too need to focus on what I I think will best benefit me professionally, not try and keep up with kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Actually, Luce is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/programming-language-or-shakespeare-character/?_r=0&quot;&gt;Shakespeare character, not a programming language&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>How to Really Install a New Thermostat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Going through my RSS reader this morning, I came across this article at the Art of Manliness, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/10/30/how-to-replace-a-thermostat/&quot;&gt;How to Install a New Thermostat&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn‚Äôt disagree more with 80% of what that article instructs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, while they are on the right track on turning off power, but mentioning ‚Äúflipping power switch off‚Äù is inaccurate. Also, it is obvious that this was written by someone from the north in only referencing ‚Äúfurnace‚Äù. Generally speaking, the breaker panel will have both an ‚ÄúAC‚Äù and either ‚Äúheat‚Äù or ‚Äúair handler‚Äù when it is not a furnace. These need to be off, as the 24 volt current is constant and if the heat/air handler isn‚Äôt off, then you can at the minimum blow a fuse, the worst, fry a transformer. By code, both items should have a disconnect for service, and pulling that is equally effective in making sure the power is off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, while they mention taking a photo of the wiring on your thermostat, they ignore it and simply (and wrongly) state the colors on the new thermostat match the wire color. WRONG. The terminals relate to specific functionality, and I‚Äôve seen every color under the sun wired to a terminal. Blue to the Y terminal isn‚Äôt uncommon. The O and B terminal? Those are used in heat pumps for the reversing valve and depending on the manufacturer, either one can be used. The B can be brown, or the orange wire can be used for either one. See where this is going? Also note that the C terminal is for common, and most new ‚Äúsmart‚Äù thermostats require this, so make sure you have a C wire before even making the purchase. And even if there is a wire (often blue if yellow is used for the Y terminal) that doesn‚Äôt mean that it is wired to the furnace/air handler. So while it‚Äôs not beyond DIY, there‚Äôs a lot more to it than just ‚Äúmatching colors‚Äù. And don‚Äôt get me started about what color wires may be wired into the furnace/air handler from the outdoor condensing unit. I haven‚Äôt touched on what happens if you have a two stage compressor or heat pump with backup emergency heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, if you are going to spend hundreds of dollars for a smart thermostat, spend the extra money to hire a professional or at the minimum, do your homework regarding your specific unit and be damned sure that it will handle that $250 investment before attempting a DIY&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apple Pay,  CurrentC and Profits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier today over on &lt;a href=&quot;last post on Apple Pay&quot;&gt;Pencil Note&lt;/a&gt; there was a post about Apple Pay and the author spoke to their opinion on how the CurrentC plan from retailers like CVS and Walmart would actually &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; consumers. Upon reading the post in my RSS reader, I quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miklb/status/527099202103697408&quot;&gt;tweeted a question&lt;/a&gt; asking if he really though the retailers would pass the savings onto customers. Their response was &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes. Less credit cards means lower prices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
‚Äî&lt;cite&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pencil_line/status/527176352794165248&quot;&gt;Pencil Note&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, in an old fashioned blogging style, they posted a more-than-140-character reply - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pencilnote.com/pencilnote/2014/10/28/r2c95cwsnaoikrzdizm3ecyr6xynfd&quot;&gt;Why fewer credit cards mean lower prices&lt;/a&gt;. While my formal education on economics is limited to 101 level micro &amp;amp; macro economics courses, I‚Äôve been an informed consumer for long enough to follow the train of thought in that post. While it makes sense that the retailers are fueled by growth, and there is already a race to the bottom for pricing, the end result is still more profit for the owners/shareholders. If the price drops a few cents here or there, it is my opinion that is purely a by-product of profit growth and not the intention.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Classic American Chefs Honored  on US Postage Stamps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.miklb.com/images/celebrity_chefs_stamps.png&quot; alt=&quot;Celebrity Chef Stamp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stumbling around the web this evening, came across this limited edition set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.usps.com/store/browse/uspsProductDetailMultiSkuDropDown.jsp?categoryNav=false&amp;amp;navAction=push&amp;amp;navCount=0&amp;amp;productId=S_472304&amp;amp;categoryId=buy-stamps&quot;&gt;5 American chefs celebrated on US Postage stamps&lt;/a&gt;. The one chef that stood out to me was Edna Lewis. I suppose there &lt;em&gt;isn‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; another American who personified Southern, low-country cooking more than Ms Lewis, but was still surprised to see her along side Julia Child, James Beard and others. Not surprised as though she doesn‚Äôt belong, just that she‚Äôs not as much a household name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started cooking, I stumbled onto her book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B0LP5I0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00B0LP5I0&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=miklb-20&amp;amp;linkId=FLKS4ZL23UX56HNY&quot;&gt;In Pursuit of Flavor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=miklb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00B0LP5I0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;(note, it doesn‚Äôt appear to be still in print, but a Kindle version is available). Its less a book of recipes‚Äîthough they are in the book‚Äîrather more a look into &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; she cooked. It would be an understatement to say her words in that book shaped the way I approach food even to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the names Childs and Beard speak for themselves. I‚Äôm not familiar with Felipe Rojas-Lombardi, and am only slightly familiar with Joyce Chen, but if they were deemed to be contemporaries of of Lewis and Child for their cuisines, I will look to learn about their contributions to the American plate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday (THIS is my Jam): Jason Molina</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to do these posts, and well, I got lost in social media and life‚Ä¶this evening though listening to music on my back porch (Airplay is awesome!) I went down a rabbit hole of my music library and found myself listening to Jason Molina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure when/how I discovered him; might have been after seeing My Morning Jacket at the New World Brewery in Tampa and finding his band Songs: Ohio did a split EP with MMJ. However it went, I was a fan. Pretty sure I saw him with Songs: Ohio, but I know I saw him solo. At least twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sad to read that he lost a battle. Think I read there‚Äôs a tribute album out there, but too lazy to link to it. Suffice to say, if you didn‚Äôt experience him when he walked this Earth, you might want to put him in your queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/LghRPODxqJQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if this was a ‚Äúsanctioned‚Äù video or not, but it‚Äôs quite well done. I almost want to make my own with the epic Florida summer storm clouds I see daily while driving in west central Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More About Using My Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My work life has prevented me from doing anything much related to online life, or writing much in general. That however doesn‚Äôt mean that during the hundreds of miles a day I‚Äôve been driving that I don‚Äôt think about it. While catching up on my RSS feeds, this post from the Pastry Box, &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-pastry-box-project.net/federico-brigante/2014-july-25&quot;&gt;You don‚Äôt have time for perfection&lt;/a&gt; sums up a lot of why I didn‚Äôt use it more when I actually did web development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I‚Äôve had enough of maybe-later, of I‚Äôm too busy right now, of after I‚Äôm done with this. I‚Äôll be publishing anything I think others will benefit from. Ten non-perfect pieces are better than zero wannabe-perfect ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps from where  I‚Äôm sitting, it won‚Äôt always be what I think others might benefit from, rather a benefit to me. Be it saving a snippet of code for posterity (which &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; benefit others), reflecting on a moment or just sharing thoughts about a band. Anything to have it centralized and outside the walls of Facebook, Twitter and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.miklb.com/images/stop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stop Sign&quot; /&gt;
‚Ä¶you‚Äôve heard this before. I‚Äôm going to try to use this damn blog more. I‚Äôve been tweaking it behind the scenes in my rare spare time the last couple of months, and I think I‚Äôve gotten enough of what I want to be able to use this little corner of the web as it was intended‚Äìmy digital hub. While i have found myself using Facebook more and more due to keeping tabs on IRL friends, I‚Äôve used Twitter less and less due to a busy schedule and finding it difficult to follow conversations. I‚Äôd love to find an interface that made it easy to see all of the accounts I follow and put them into lists (does that exist on twitter.com?), in the mean time, I simply want to start collecting everything back here and sharing it to social media as I see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New but Not New Laptop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My late 2010 Macbook Air had run out of hard drive space. It was a never ending battle to find space, constantly cleaning caches and removing large, mostly unused apps. Something had to give. Then on Twitter, an internet friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jptoto&quot;&gt;@jptoto&lt;/a&gt; mentioned he was adding an SSD drive to his MacMini. When I looked at OWC, where he linked to, I discovered there was an option to upgrading the SSD in my Air. I have no complaints about the 4 year old Air, other than the regret  I didn‚Äôt get a larger SSD drive to begin with. Buying a new laptop was not in my budget, and save for more RAM and faster processor, which I don‚Äôt really need, didn‚Äôt make sense. If Retina display was an option for an 11‚Äù Air, I might have rethought the option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I decided that I was going to upgrade the SSD hard drive in my Macbook Air, I had to decide how I was going to go about setting it back up after the upgrade. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://eshop.macsales.com/articles/how-to-transfer-your-data-from-your-old-drive-to-a-new-drive&quot;&gt;instructions on OWC&lt;/a&gt; walks through migrating your old content back via the enclosure as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/OWC/Air-Retina/Apple-MacBook-Air-2010-Drive-Internal-Flash&quot;&gt;kit I purchased &lt;/a&gt;. However, after 4 years, I was ready for a clean start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to decide how I was going to back everything up. Well, I already have all important files/data backed up, but I needed to run through what I was doing to make sure my bases were covered. First, I use iCloud for all of my contacts, calendars, Safari day-to-day bookmarks (I use Pinboard for most of my bookmarks) and surprisingly more and more app data. Second, I use Dropbox religiously, so all of my text notes are synced inside Dropbox (as well as with SimpleNote). Additionally, all of my work files are saved into Dropbox, as well as other misc files. I may revisit my organization of Dropbox once I have the extra 180 GB of data on my laptop to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, I use 1Password for all of my, well, passwords, but also software licenses that are not bought through the App Store. Which is another is another method of backing up software these days. It really is a convenient way of having your apps &lt;em&gt;just there.&lt;/em&gt; I followed that up with a full backup using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/superduperdescription.html&quot;&gt;SuperDuper&lt;/a&gt;. And not to be outdone, I did a Time Machine backup to an external hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result? Complete success. I did a clean install of Lion, loaded up the App Store and upgraded to Mavericks. Easily added my iCloud credentials, downloaded  Dropbox (I did have to reference that password via my iPhone which also has 1Password installed. I needed Dropbox to load my 1Password keychain.) After Mavericks, again using the App Store downloaded said 1Password and selectively installing apps I know I‚Äôve been using. It is easy enough to go back and add one already purchased when needed, but the goal was to start clean. There were a few things I didn‚Äôt think about directly such as ssh keys for Github/Bitbucket and my VPS, but since I had redundant backups of my entire system, I simply copied those over to my home directory. Certainly I could have generated new keys, but this was obviously easier. I also had to copy over my Hazel license, as I do not use the email address it was registered under, but I had already looked into that prior to the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far it has been liberating starting clean, as I was carrying over more than 4 years of cruft from this Air; I migrated the user account over from the Powerbook I upgraded from. I am looking to use this momentum to carry over to other areas of my technology world, most specifically in my task management. I tried to be an Omnifocus convert (from being a half-assed Things user), but the delays in a desktop update slowed my enthusiasm for the suite of apps to the point I wasn‚Äôt using it any longer anyway. Perhaps the beta will drop soon and I can revisit it, but I‚Äôm now looking at some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macdrifter.com/2014/02/the-taskpaper-rd-notebook.html&quot;&gt;Task Paper options&lt;/a&gt; on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one area I am still on the fence on is for development. I thought I‚Äôd use Vagrant and Virtualbox, but the closer I looked into it, the more I wasn‚Äôt sure I really needed to get that deep. I hack for fun now (mostly, I do have a company website I‚Äôm building), and MAMP really does cover my local development needs. I can always &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; with Vagrant at a later date, if for instance I really wanted a local dev environment to match my VPS. But for general hacking, and to get down to it, I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm sticking with MAMP for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can‚Äôt do a clean install of your computer, I highly recommend a strong spring cleaning. It just might get you focused on other aspects of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Grand Ole Opry </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt grow up listening to the show, but I did listen to enough AM country growing up traveling around the country and out and about with my father to have a deep appreciation for what it meant to those who did. Visiting the Opry is still on my bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears the Opry house in its current incarnation turns 40 this month, and Garden &amp;amp; Gun‚Äôs article &lt;a href=&quot;http://gardenandgun.com/blog/lordy-lordy-oprys-40&quot;&gt;Lordy, Lordy, the Opry‚Äôs 40!&lt;/a&gt; has a few quotes from artists who‚Äôve performed there over the years. My favorite is from Ricky Skaggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;‚ÄúI used to go to sleep on my grandfather‚Äôs lap, listening to the Grand Ole Opry in his Ford pickup truck out by the barn. The sound would come and go up in those Kentucky mountains, but when it would come back in, it was the greatest sound in the world.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the reference to sleeping on his grandfather‚Äôs lap as the music came and went is what struck me, as I my earliest memories of music were with my head asleep on dad‚Äôs lap as we drove across country.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Choose to‚Ä¶</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve long been a fan of David Seah, but something &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidseah.com/blog/2014/02/the-quest-for-productivity-enhancing-programming-pants/&quot;&gt;he wrote today&lt;/a&gt; really resonated with me in relation to &lt;strong&gt;getting things done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was armed with a new insight from The Now Habit: say ‚ÄúI choose‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù. When I say ‚ÄúI choose‚Äù, I am putting myself in charge of MY OWN MISSION and rising above whatever primordial slug-like fears lurk in the darkest recesses of my psyche.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often recall a similar exercise a wise man shared with me. He handed me a tennis ball and asked me to ‚Äútry‚Äù and throw it. I easily tossed it across the room. He retrieved the ball and handed it back to me. He said, ‚Äúno, &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt; and throw it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was confused. I just had. So I threw the ball with a bit more force. His response was the same. Finally, he told me, ‚Äúyou either throw it or you don‚Äôt. There is no in between. The next time you say ‚ÄòI am trying‚Äô, remember the ball.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was all in response to a conversation about me saying I was &lt;strong&gt;trying&lt;/strong&gt; to be a better boss/boyfriend/person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I will choose to be a better partner/boyfriend/person.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Use Pythonista to Get Weather of Current Location into Drafts App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My quest began when I began using Drafts app (among many other ways) to keep a fishing log. I created a TextExpander fill-in snippet to quickly enter what (if anything) was caught, the date, the type of lure(s) used, etc. I really wanted to automate adding the weather conditions as well, but alas, my search for that solution turned up nothing‚Ä¶until yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drdrang&quot;&gt;@drdrang&lt;/a&gt; shared a &lt;a href=&quot;http://omz-software.com/pythonista/&quot;&gt;Pythonista&lt;/a&gt; script to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/01/location-and-leverage/&quot;&gt;leverage the location inside iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Later he shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/hiilppp/8268816&quot;&gt;another version&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hiilppp&quot;&gt;@hiilppp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with that knowledge and a rudimentary knowledge of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.forecast.io&quot;&gt;forecast.io API&lt;/a&gt;, I set off to &lt;strike&gt;steal&lt;/strike&gt; crib some Python usage of their API. Enter  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayhickey&quot;&gt;@jayhickey&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jayhickey/Pythonista-Scripts/blob/master/PySky.py&quot;&gt;PySky&lt;/a&gt; script. While written for the v1 Dark Skies API, it gave me enough Python to convert to the new v2 of Forecast.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/miklb/8346411.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/miklb/8346411&quot;&gt;original gist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version simply grabs the current weather summary and temperature from your current location, meant to be used with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/draftsapp&quot;&gt;@draftsapp&lt;/a&gt; as a URL action &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pythonista : / / py_forecast?action=run&amp;amp;argv=[[draft]]&lt;/code&gt;. Dr. Drang suggests using &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/omz/4076735&quot;&gt;New From Gist&lt;/a&gt;, however I had better success using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ioctocat.com&quot;&gt;iOctocat&lt;/a&gt;. There is an ‚Äúopen in‚Ä¶‚Äù dialog when viewing your gists or starred gists, and pick Pythonista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly for my fishing log I am expanding on this to include wind, sunrise and set times as well as the recently added moon phase. I figured a more generic version would be best shared, but please do not hesitate to leave a comment or  ask me a question on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miklb&quot;&gt;@miklb&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôll do my best to help, as I‚Äôm indebted to the aforementioned gents for sharing their code and helping in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll have a lot more to say in the coming days, but suffice to say once again things are wonky/broken around here. I am sporting a nice new look that I completely fell in love with, compliments of &lt;a href=&quot;http://markdotto.com&quot;&gt;Mark Otto&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôm porting his theme to Habari and will write more about that soon too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Passion vs Desire</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon this quote from Thomas Keller a few days ago, and it‚Äôs been haunting me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It‚Äôs not about passion. Passion is something that we tend to overemphasize, that we certainly place too much importance on. Passion ebbs and flows. To me, it‚Äôs about desire. If you have constant, unwavering desire to be a cook, then you‚Äôll be a great cook. If it‚Äôs only about passion, sometimes you‚Äôll be good and sometimes you won‚Äôt. You‚Äôve got to come in every day with a strong desire. With passion, if you see the first asparagus of the springtime and you become passionate about it, so much the better, but three weeks later, when you‚Äôve seen that asparagus every day now, passions have subsided. What‚Äôs going to make you treat the asparagus the same? It‚Äôs the desire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672282/thomas-keller-on-why-passion-shouldn-t-drive-you&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I certainly can relate to the culinary element of this ‚Äì I think I had the desire ‚Äì it strikes a nerve more so in my &lt;em&gt;career&lt;/em&gt; as a web developer. I think I had the passion, just not the desire. Three weeks after the first time I used some new tool or trick, it lost its luster. I didn‚Äôt get excited, I wasn‚Äôt the type of person to want to get up early and do it all over again. So I spent the last year or so of being a developer chasing the newest shiny thing so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after reading this, I‚Äôm not sure it would have struck a nerve if I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd found a new profession that I do have the desire for. Long after the bloom is off the rose, I‚Äôm still excited to do the routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I target redfish routinely in Tampa Bay, and while I often fall back to the classic blackened redfish, this sounds like a nice change of pace. I might tweak it by using a little wine, probably a riesling, but otherwise, sounds like a perfect spring dish.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eighth Anniversary Redesign Underway</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally started this blog 8 years ago. A lot has happened since then. While I learned a lot building out the last design, a lot has changed regarding HTML, CSS and more so, responsive design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to update with what I‚Äôm working on as I continue this, rest assured, it‚Äôs going to be very rough around the edges, but that‚Äôs a sure fire way of making sure I complete this. I‚Äôm not even sure if comments are working, or I‚Äôd say leave a message if you see something you‚Äôd like to see more of, or is so horribly broken the site doesn‚Äôt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to bring back my old content, and am leaning now towards manually moving over posts that I‚Äôd like to have around for posterity. Doing so manually sounds tedious, but will allow me to clean up the markup.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I‚Äôll probably do the same with all of my old food blog posts as well. I‚Äôm using a little plugin that &lt;a href=&quot;http://asymptomatic.net&quot;&gt;Owen&lt;/a&gt;  whipped up for using post-formats. Similar to how WordPress does, but much better in my opinion. I‚Äôll definitely write more about that after I get the kinks worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; Seems I can‚Äôt remove localhost from the free pictos account I set up and add the live domain. Waiting on support, but not holding my breath. Not willing to pay for the service until I can see it live. Might start looking for alternatives. Also, reading their support threads, seems like a big headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2&lt;/strong&gt; Ran into some issues, switching back over to previous theme for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which means converting everything over to using Markdown and cleaning up broken links and images. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost brought me to tears when I watched this last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit I too have a fascination with mid-century food stuffs. I have several boxes of those little recipe books put out by various companies pimping their products. I also have a hand-bound collection of recipes from magazines that I thrifted. Might need to dust off the scanner and start sharing some after seeing this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the perfect tool for those who want to help write documentation but are put off by a particular markup (read, Mediawiki).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are on a Mac, use Markdown and don‚Äôt have these, get them now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another brilliant idea for over night guests. Or a brunch party. Just add pitchers of sangria and mimosas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-indicted-over-contaminated-peanut-butter-linked-to-9-deaths-&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2020407416_peanutbuttertaintedxml.html?syndication=rss&quot;&gt;‚Äã4‚Äã ‚Äãi‚Äãn‚Äãd‚Äãi‚Äãc‚Äãt‚Äãe‚Äãd‚Äã ‚Äão‚Äãv‚Äãe‚Äãr‚Äã ‚Äãc‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãm‚Äãi‚Äãn‚Äãa‚Äãt‚Äãe‚Äãd‚Äã ‚Äãp‚Äãe‚Äãa‚Äãn‚Äãu‚Äãt‚Äã ‚Äãb‚Äãu‚Äãt‚Äãt‚Äãe‚Äãr‚Äã ‚Äãl‚Äãi‚Äãn‚Äãk‚Äãe‚Äãd‚Äã ‚Äãt‚Äão‚Äã ‚Äã9‚Äã ‚Äãd‚Äãe‚Äãa‚Äãt‚Äãh‚Äãs‚Äã ‚Äã|‚Äã&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty big deal. Finally the government is holding big business responsible for food safety via felony charges directed at those at the top of the, ehem, &lt;em&gt;food chain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure of the practicality of this, but I do like the bookmarklet. Could be handy for taking info on a website and convert to markdown for plain text editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well written post demystifying running nginx with php-fpm. Wish this was around when I set up my server, but won‚Äôt be long until I take note and adjust my setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just fucking brilliant. I also learned when I first started cooking that you can cook a roux in the oven at 325¬∞ and it will never burn. Restaurants in New Orleans that serve massive amounts of gumbos and √©touff√©e use the technique over night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm tempted to test out Omni Focus since they are offering a free license until 2.0 is released. Seems like a nice starting point for jumping into the system. Just not sure ready for the outlay of cash for iOS versions and desktop since I‚Äôve bought Things already‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always nice to have a couple of mackerel recipes. This one reminds me of Lyonnaise Potatoes, which I learned to brush the potatoes with a little dijon mustard. I think it would be a nice touch to brush the mackerel with the mustard in this recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leave it to the Wayback Machine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been lamenting on whether or not I wanted to bring back my old content or start completely from scratch. I‚Äôd been leaning towards starting over, but today in Habari IRC channel, someone linked to their blog on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/web/web.php&quot;&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;, which led me to checking this blog. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20050319093337/http://www.miklb.com/blog/&quot;&gt;earliest records&lt;/a&gt; are sans any theme. I‚Äôm not sure what determined what got cached visually, but the earliest version of this site that &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20051030021240/http://www.miklb.com/blog/&quot;&gt;includes design&lt;/a&gt; got me feeling nostalgic about having had this site active off and on for almost 8 years. Between that old theme and &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20060814212436/http://www.miklb.com/blog/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; I think I will work out bringing back the old content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, I‚Äôve been running on Habari since September 2008, never looking back.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Terminal.app &amp;amp; Solarized</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was new to me, but I‚Äôve been using Terminal.app a lot lately setting up my new VPS. As a big fan of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized&quot;&gt;Solarized Color Scheme&lt;/a&gt;, began to wonder if I could use that with Terminal.app. A quick Google search quickly returned &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tomislav/osx-lion-terminal.app-colors-solarized&quot;&gt;OS Lion terminal colors - Solarized&lt;/a&gt;. As I‚Äôm still on Lion, it‚Äôs a simple as downloading the zip, extracting, double clicking the preferred scheme (light or dark) to activate it. The readme file says Mountain Lion users can import the file via preferences. The only hitch was as a user of &lt;a href=&quot;http://totalfinder.binaryage.com&quot;&gt;TotalFinder&lt;/a&gt; I couldn‚Äôt get it to use the new default Solarized color scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another quick search turned up that this was not a bug, but a (bad IMVHO) design decision. If the Visor color scheme is available, regardless of the default scheme in Terminal, it will use Visor. Apparently the options are renaming the color schemes, or, as I chose to do, delete Visor scheme from Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I use the light scheme for all of my text editors, I‚Äôm leaning towards the dark for TotalTerminal. My next step will probably be to edit my .bash profile to change the prompt colors, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm that big a geek today.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I'm Back‚Ä¶</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This site has been down for several months due to a multitude of reasons. That said, I‚Äôm still not 100% what I‚Äôm going to do next, but I‚Äôm leaning towards keeping it completely free of any and all content that I accumulated the first seven years. While there is something to be said for posterity, an equal argument can be made for clean starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I‚Äôm running the latest stable version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://habariproject.org&quot;&gt;Habari&lt;/a&gt; on an inexpensive VPS that is only running Ngnix and Sqlite. No Apache, no Mysql. That part will stay.  From there, I‚Äôm just not quite sure, other than I will not have a filter on my content ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the one or two people who stumble into this new incarnation, I am no longer doing any type of web work/development professionally, save for a business that I‚Äôm helping &lt;em&gt;ehem&lt;/em&gt;, ‚Äúbootstrap‚Äù. I‚Äôll be writing more about that for sure, suffice to say this &lt;em&gt;NY Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24labor-t.html?_r=5&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; touches on where I‚Äôve been mentally and professionally the last couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pardon the Mess</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the process of moving the site over from Slicehost to Linode, so there may be some issues while I sort things out. Pardon the dust.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using APC and Subversion Checkouts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am in the process of moving my sites from Slicehost to Linode, as most are aware Slicehost is being phased out for Rackspace Cloud.  Anyway, I upgraded my VPS at Linode last night to Debian ‚ÄúSqueeze‚Äù and installed APC, which created a problem with the WordPress installations I had there.  Basically, I couldn‚Äôt access the admin.  Through the power of Twitter and the invaluable help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://markjaquith.com/&quot;&gt;Mark Jaquith&lt;/a&gt;, I learned that by default APC doesn‚Äôt play nice with files that are checked out via Subversion.  I think the root of my problem was a stray apc config for overriding include once, but certainly the subversion issue could have been at play too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a little Googling on the subject, I discovered there‚Äôs a configuration option for APC to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php#ini.apc.stat-ctime&quot;&gt;ctime&lt;/a&gt;  instead of the default mtime.  Adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apc.stat_ctime=1&lt;/code&gt; is all that is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I‚Äôm on the subject of migrating from Slicehost to Linode, &lt;a href=&quot;http://developerkarma.com/&quot;&gt;Andrew RIley&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that someone had written a ruby script to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Schultz/slicedns2linode&quot;&gt;migrate the DNS information&lt;/a&gt; for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum&lt;/em&gt; To be clear, I install WordPress using Subversion and the appropriate tag. My Habari installs are also all Subversion checkouts from trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Technology, Civil War &amp;amp; Parallels</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/imageclectic/5604423448/&quot; title=&quot;Telegraph Key by wblj, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5604423448_7acc49ff46.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Telegraph Key&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I‚Äôve been really enjoying both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lib.unc.edu/blogs/civilwar/&quot;&gt;Civil War Day By Day&lt;/a&gt; Blog, as well as the Disunion series in the Opininator from the &lt;cite&gt;NY Times&lt;/cite&gt;.  Earlier this week Disunion had an article,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/communication-breakdown/?ref=opinion&quot;&gt;Morse, The Telegraph &amp;amp; Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.  The gist of the article is that the advent of the Telegraph allowed for quicker and faster communication, and coupled with advances of the printing press, allowed for more newspapers to take hold, each with their own &lt;quote&gt;partisan orientation.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This speed of communication allowed for the schism between North and South to broaden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead, of course, national unity unraveled as antagonistic North-South stereotypes hardened during the 1850s.  The dominant modern narrative of mid-19th century American history suggests that North and South began to see each other more clearly ‚Äî and that each discovered how genuinely different the other had become. While a fast-changing North embraced progress and improvement, the South remained wedded to an archaic, retrogressive labor system. Under the circumstances, Northern and Southern outlooks and values necessarily diverged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me most though about this article is how it parallels today‚Äôs current events and how the advances in technology and the internet can be directly attributed to the uprising in the Middle East, as well as to some degree the political discourse in our own country.  The 24 hour news cycle, and the fact that anyone can start a blog/website to argue their stance has really changed the way politics is done in the United States. We just had our first presidential candidate announce his candidacy via Twitter.  A politician was run out of Washington due to his use of Craigslist and the ability of a website to get a hold of the email exchange and image to quickly get it out, being picked up by mainstream media, resulting in his resignation within days of the story hitting the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess it goes to prove the old adage, &lt;em&gt;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog, Blogs, Blogging - A Rant</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had this draft sitting around for awhile, but in the last two days I‚Äôve seen the word ‚Äúblog‚Äù used incorrectly several times, and decided to dust this off and publish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.  When writing for this web log, you are blogging, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to &lt;strong&gt;blog&lt;/strong&gt; about the movie we saw last night‚Äù, I &lt;em&gt;blogged&lt;/em&gt; about how I built the best mouse trap. You can call yourself a blogger.  &lt;span class=&quot;pquote-r&quot;&gt; A blog however is not each individual entry or post you write.&lt;/span&gt; Please do not tell me you wrote 3 blogs last night.  You can tell me you blogged 3 articles, or you wrote 3 entries for your blog, but you did not write 3 blogs. Do not tweet ‚Äúmy new blog‚Äù and link to an entry. When I see ‚Äúnew blog‚Äù I‚Äôm expecting a completely new site from the one you already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don‚Äôt claim to be a grammar nazi or even have the best grammar. But this is less about grammar and more about semantics and something that simply gets my goat.  Feel free to contradict or refute my position. I‚Äôm all ears.  Also, I came across a great blog &lt;strong&gt;post&lt;/strong&gt; sometime back, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html&quot;&gt;on the history of weblogs&lt;/a&gt; you may find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

Why? It‚Äôs a little late for citrus in general. Also, my native ass says kumquats are an even earlier citrus.  Also, they look similar (not really).  Taste: no comparison.  A super ripe loquat to me is a cross between a mango and peach. And heaven. Relish the wild loquats our fore fathers planted and the birds have spread Ybor and Seminole Heights neighbors. They are a treat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Latest DailyBooth Image</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://dailybooth.com/&quot;&gt;Dailyboth&lt;/a&gt;, at it‚Äôs core, it makes it easy to snap a picture of yourself and share it on the web.  They have a lot of other ‚Äúsocial‚Äù aspects, like comments, following, etc, however I don‚Äôt really use any of those.  I started using it track my mustache growth for Movember, and then while I grew out a beard.  It‚Äôs easy and it can be fun.  I got to thinking today it would be cool if you could leverage that image else where besides within their network, and set off looking if they had an API and how might I do so.&lt;img src=&quot;http://dailybooth.com/miklb/latest/medium.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;miklb dailybooth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered they do have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dailybooth.com/category/api/&quot;&gt;basic API&lt;/a&gt;, along with some sample code in GitHub.  All I really wanted for now was a to pull my latest picture.  A little more digging, I realized I didn‚Äôt need to leverage the API, rather you can reference that image in a simple HTML &lt;code&gt;&lt;img /&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://dailybooth.com/username/latest/small.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also swap small, with medium or large.  The one  downside is that their images are not square, rather they are rectangular, which doesn‚Äôt work in most ‚Äòprofile‚Äô environments.  I experimented with taking it a step further and using that latest image link with Gravatar, however from what I can tell, while Gravatar will allow you to choose the latest image, for performance reasons, they cache the various size images and don‚Äôt ever check that source again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not be useful to many people, but in my case, with my ever changing long hair/short hair and various states of facial hair, I often find that I‚Äôve had a photo on my about page that becomes outdated. When I meet someone in person, they hardly recognize me.  It happened when I met my current employer. Due to the nature of working on the web these days, in person meetings may not occur often or right away as most correspondences occur via email and the phone.  Having an outdated image that people are using as a visual reference isn‚Äôt necessarily bad, but it‚Äôs nice to be able to really put a face with a name, even if it‚Äôs from 2000 miles away.  Thus, I‚Äôve updated my &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/about&quot;&gt;about me page&lt;/a&gt; with my latest Dailybooth shot, so I don‚Äôt have to remember to change it.  I‚Äôm also experimenting with using it for the author bio pic at the bottom of posts, but as you can see, the aforementioned issue with rectangle vs square is an issue. I may investigate the CSS &lt;code&gt;clip&lt;/code&gt; property for a short term solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if there was a mashup somewhere between a service like Dailybooth and Gravatar where you could keep an up-to-date profile pic handy.  Possibly even being able to update your Twitter avatar at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Firefox 4 HTML5 Forms - Input Types</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Firefox 4, I‚Äôve gotten a few comments on my post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/firefox-4-app-tab&quot;&gt;Firefox 4 app tabs&lt;/a&gt;, and while trying to respond, I discovered another new ‚Äòfeature‚Äô in Firefox 4, support for HTML 5 input types.  Inadvertently I was using the same input for my URL field as my email. I had created some custom formcontrols for  &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Dev:FormUI&quot;&gt;Habari‚Äôs FormUI templates&lt;/a&gt; for HTML5 support, which had the right input types, so at first I didn‚Äôt see why I was getting the error. However with help in Habari‚Äôs IRC channel from Mike Lietz, he pointed out in my theme.php file I was calling the email formcontrol for URL as well as Email.  Fixing that, I was able to submit my comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/html5_input-type_email.png&quot; alt=&quot;Firefox4 HTML 5 input type email error&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;A quick Google search turned up that , indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/HTML5/Forms_in_HTML5&quot;&gt;Gecko 2 (Firefox 4) supports HTML5 input types&lt;/a&gt;.  I had also checked in Chrome 10.x and it too gave the same error, which means it also supports the input types. IE 9 nor Safari 5 have support for the input types (Mac, ironically the Windows version seems to support it).  Finally, Opera 10 has supported this for a while, as well as iOS Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it all mean?  Why use it if it‚Äôs not really supported in all major browsers?  Well, first, using &lt;code&gt; type=&quot;email&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;type=&quot;url&quot;&lt;/code&gt; won‚Äôt break anything. Browsers that don‚Äôt support it treat it like a text input.  But those that do, well, as you can see in the screenshot, you get instant validation without any heavy lifting by your site.  As support grows, you won‚Äôt have to update any code.  iOS Safari support includes providing a different default keyboard layout (the ampersand and .com keys are on the home screen). I can‚Äôt speak to Android‚Äôs browser, though I‚Äôd suspect it has similar behavior.  Really there‚Äôs no reason &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to start using them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Firefox 4 App Tab</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;T&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/Firefox4_app_tab.png&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Firefox 4 App Tab&quot; /&gt;he App tabs in Firefox 4 was a feature I hadn‚Äôt seen until this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2011/03/24/firefox-4-the-app-tab-an-instant-time-saver/&quot;&gt;handy post from Freshbooks&lt;/a&gt; passed through Reeder.  It was immediately one of those ‚Äúhow awesome is that moments.‚Äù  I live in Basecamp, so that was my immediate thought.  But then, oh, yeah, Pinboard, and Instapaper.  Now I‚Äôm looking for other sites I routinely visit daily to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Firefox 4, I was literally a day away from looking at switching to Chrome as my everyday browser, but I checked out the release candidate and pleasantly surprised by the difference.  A few days later it was formally released, and I‚Äôm no longer looking to switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you found any hidden gem features in Firefox 4?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday - Neko Case</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps today‚Äôs Tunesday was inspired by the plethora of &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/nekocase&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; I‚Äôve seen from her the past few days (to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nekocase.com/auction/index.htm&quot;&gt;raise money to help students with creative writing&lt;/a&gt;), coupled with a beautiful woman I recently met giving me ‚Äúbonus points‚Äù for liking Neko Case. Or it‚Äôs just that I love Neko Case‚Äôs voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve had a love affair with her voice for about 8 years, since I first heard &lt;cite&gt;Porchlight&lt;/cite&gt; from the soundtrack to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266971/&quot;&gt;Slaughter Rule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was working 100hr weeks, and rarely had time to find music outside of emusic.com, but I was able to get my hands on &lt;cite&gt;Furnace Room Lullaby&lt;/cite&gt;.  And while I didn‚Äôt race out to buy more of her music, I often came back to that album.  A couple of years later &lt;cite&gt;Fox Confessor Brings the Flood&lt;/cite&gt; was released, and if I wasn‚Äôt smitten (mind you, I‚Äôd probably never even seen her photo, it was purely the soul and emotion of her voice, not some school boy crush on a pretty face - though I now know that‚Äôs the case too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Margaret vs Pauline&lt;/cite&gt; immediately joined my heavy rotation list, and is still on one of my favorite play lists.  Since then I‚Äôve acquired &lt;cite&gt;The Virginian&lt;/cite&gt;, an earlier recording, as well as what I think is her latest recording, &lt;cite&gt;Middle Cyclone&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, by the time i discovered she was playing in Orlando a little over a year ago, the show was sold out.  I‚Äôm anxiously awaiting the next opportunity, in the meantime I leave you with &lt;cite&gt;Star Witness&lt;/cite&gt; off of &lt;cite&gt;Fox Confessor Brings the Flood&lt;/cite&gt;, from the aforementioned sold out show in Orlando, Florida December of ‚Äò09.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Neko Case - &lt;cite&gt;Star Witness&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Tables For Layout: Now Conforming</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you‚Äôve been lost in all of the SXSWi hullabaloo, or just neck deep in work like myself, it seems the W3C HTML Working Group has &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011Mar/0245.html&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; using role=presentation on a table element is now conforming.  So it seems after 5 years of fighting this out in the trenches, per one  rebuttal to the proposal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the past decade or more, Web designers have been moving away from tables for layout. For a while, limitations in the market leading Web browser made this somewhat impractical for sites with complicated flexible layouts that had to be compatible with a broad range of user agents, but this is no longer the case, and new sites can avoid using tables without difficulty. Old sites won't change, but old sites are not affected by changes to conformance criteria, since they already exist. Conformance criteria only affect actively developed sites, and those can move away from tables (and many avoid using tables at all).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counter argument from the working group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This assertion does not mention a specific example. By contrast the authors of the proposal to make &lt;code&gt;&lt;table role=&quot;presention&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; conforming cite gmail, facebook, yahoo mail, numerous IBM applications, and toolkits such as DOJO and YUI. As each of these are actively maintained, we find that there was insufficient evidence provided to back up this assertion.
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
So Facebook prevails (again)?  God help us all.
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Miklb.com Turns 6</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/36112884@N07/3787346825/&quot; title=&quot;Birthday Cake by Im a terrible photographer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2640/3787346825_57a6001c20.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;Birthday Cake&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;knew it was right around this time, but it seems that this little slice of the web turned 6 this weekend, as did my twisting adventure of making a living building web sites.  Seems like yesterday still I was purchasing my first tiny plan from A Small Orange and installing WordPress 1.2.  Now I have 2 different VPS‚Äôs, manage 100‚Äôs of WordPress sites for work on a dedicated server (&lt;em&gt;managed&lt;/em&gt;, I‚Äôm not that much a masochist), and moved onto Habari for my personal sites.  Ironically or not, those that started Habari were some of the very ones that welcomed me into WordPress and were the ones that probably have helped me the most to get where I‚Äôve gotten today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôd like to share this virtual cake particularly with &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjdavis.org/&quot;&gt;Chis J Davis&lt;/a&gt;, as the first theme I tore apart to customize was one of his (among many others down the road), &lt;a href=&quot;http://asymptomatic.net/&quot;&gt;Owen Winkler&lt;/a&gt; for the many plugins I used to get started as well as the many hours of tutelage over the years on a variety of subjects, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://skippy.net/&quot;&gt;Scott Merrill&lt;/a&gt;, because in addition to his many plugins and welcoming nature, his patience in helping walk me through setting up my first VPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many, many more who‚Äôve helped me through these past six years I couldn‚Äôt begin to name them all, but please know I‚Äôm eternally grateful to each and every one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Towards a Responsive Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not sure I had really paid attention to the term &lt;em&gt;responsive design&lt;/em&gt; when I started the redesign for this site. I just knew I wanted something that would be as readable on an iPhone as it was on my large desktop monitor.  I made some conscious decisions to remove a bunch of extraneous elements not for the mobile viewing, but I simply wanted to focus attention on what ever it was I was writing about.  Sidebars full of links, tweets, buttons and badges might have been novel 6 years ago when I started this site, but not so important to me now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to learn more about HTML5 and CSS3.  For my own site, I‚Äôm completely not interested in supporting old browsers, save for using a HTML5 polyfill for &amp;lt; IE 9.  If someone is using IE 6, they probably don‚Äôt have much interest in what I‚Äôm sharing anyway.  So I played with some max-widths and widths based on percentage until I found something that worked for me.  Perhaps that‚Äôs not the best way to approach it, as the site really should be about those visiting, but I guess &lt;span class=&quot;pquote-r&quot;&gt;I made an assumption my browsers/screen resolutions/mobile devices were common enough that if it looked OK to me, it should look OK to visitors.&lt;/span&gt;  Up until today, I was fairly happy with what I had come up with, save for the Youtube videos I‚Äôve been posting.  I have been experimenting with using the HTML5 iframe wrapper Youtube offers, and choosing a very large version of the video.  Which wasn‚Äôt working out for smaller screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I‚Äôm studying more about the advanced concepts of responsive design and using media queries, I ran across Ethan Marcotte‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images/&quot;&gt;fluid images&lt;/a&gt; post.  Lo and behold, I set &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;code&gt;iframe {max-width: 100%}&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; and my video posts scale along with the surrounding content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure I will mess with this site anytime soon code or design wise, but I do intend to experiment with using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessframework.com/&quot;&gt;Less Framework&lt;/a&gt; and possibly the intriguing &lt;a href=&quot;http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_images_experimenting_with_context_aware_image_sizing/&quot;&gt;context aware responsive images&lt;/a&gt; script over on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://cookingwith.miklb.com&quot;&gt;cooking site&lt;/a&gt;, which is a blueprint based grid design spun off of the markup of this site.  I don‚Äôt think it would take much to convert the grid to the Less Framework.  I may think about a design that‚Äôs not quite as similar to this in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the direction, I‚Äôd like to thank Kevin Zurawel for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://arborwebsolutions.com/2011/03/wordcamp-miami-2011/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Miami session on responsive design&lt;/a&gt; and piquing my interest on the subject even more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Speaking of Twitter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to setting up &lt;a href=&quot;http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/&quot;&gt;Tweet Nest&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweets.miklb.com&quot;&gt;http://tweets.miklb.com&lt;/a&gt;, to archive, well, my tweets.  Seems Twitter only goes back so far, so I don‚Äôt have &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of them, but I think I have an archive somewhere that does. May look at figuring out how to add those in at some point.  Tweet Nest is a very cool little open source app.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Twitter Clients and Their Change in TOS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The plot thickens.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://seancoates.com&quot;&gt;Sean Coates&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/coates/status/47642561044680706&quot;&gt;pointed out on Twitter this morning&lt;/a&gt; that the Twitter API announcement has been pulled, with no obvious response.  Most of the mailing list message is still available in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/mar/14/twitter-developers-client-warning&quot;&gt;article in the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I‚Äôm not a developer of software.  I make websites. I use Twitter. A lot sometimes. &lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/dead_bird_twitter.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;  I have found the reaction to Twitter‚Äôs curious &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a&quot;&gt;announcement in the change in their terms of service&lt;/a&gt; interesting.  Granted, most reactions I have read are from developer types, so it may be biased.  The sentiment  could be summed up in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/GlennF/status/46442047980310528&quot;&gt;tweet I saw today&lt;/a&gt;, ‚ÄúTwitter: from #dickbar to #dickmove‚Äù. That basically Twitter added a new ‚Äúfeature‚Äù in their most recent mobile app that absolutely no one liked and users were abuzz with suggestions for other clients.  Rather than listen to these users (granted, they did release a minor update that apparently mitigates to a degree the trending bar, &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/06/dickbar&quot;&gt;coined by Gruber&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;dickbar&lt;/em&gt;) they simply decided to post to a mailing list telling developers to not plan on being able to create alternate clients.  Poor timing? Possibly. They very well could have been planning this announcement for some time.  Still seems odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pquote-l&quot;&gt;But what if they had challenged themselves internally? &lt;/span&gt;  ‚ÄúWe are going to make such a kick ass experience for the desktop, mobile and web, users won‚Äôt bother with these imitators.‚Äù  They could have looked at who was doing great things with the iPhone and the desktop and simply hired them to make their product better.  Listened to their users to see what features these other clients were offering and &lt;strong&gt;make them better&lt;/strong&gt;.  Isn‚Äôt that what free-market competition should be all about? Not, ‚Äúhey, thanks for helping build up our user base, now go screw yourselves.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Twitter really reminded me that I don‚Äôt pay for it, so I can‚Äôt really bitch about it, and should remember my goal of &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/less-twitter-more-me&quot;&gt;Less Twitter, more me.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday: Crooked Fingers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While revisiting the Avett Bros tonight in my music library, the next band was Archers of Loaf, which got me to thinking what was Eric Bachmann‚Äôs subsequent project up to?  So I Googled them and discovered they‚Äôre going to be in Tampa February 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the seminal shows I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of experiencing in Ybor City (or any where for that matter) was a Crooked Fingers show at the New World Brewery.  It was one of the coldest nights, particularly that late in winter I‚Äôve ever known. Due to some circumstances beyond my understanding, they &lt;strong&gt;had to&lt;/strong&gt; play New World, and because of the cold, had to play inside.  One thing led to another, sound issues, I don‚Äôt know, but the band played, literally, on the bar unplugged.  Mind you, there might have been 50 people tops in the place that night, but if you ask anyone now, they were there.  I mean, if you‚Äôve ever been inside that bar, it‚Äôs not big.  They were &lt;strong&gt;standing on the bar&lt;/strong&gt;, moving from as you enter counter clock-wise until they finished up the set in front of the jukebox.  If the clich√© ‚Äúepic‚Äù could better be applied, I‚Äôm not sure where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve gathered more of their music over the years, still find myself listening to the Archers of Loaf‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;All the Nation‚Äôs Airports&lt;/cite&gt; and am stoked to see a where a serious song writer‚Äôs taken his craft.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Geography Lesson Compliments of SW Air</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to pride myself on knowing this little country of the USA pretty well.  I‚Äôve driven back and forth, up and down, and just about everywhere in between.  I would have thought I knew every town that an airline like Southwest Air would service.  That is until today.  The ‚Äúding‚Äù alert was for Harlingen.  Not only did I not know where that was, I hadn‚Äôt even ever heard of the town.  But thankfully to the power of Google, I now know it‚Äôs a border town in SE Texas. South of both Corpus Christ and San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Harlingen&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Harlingen,+Cameron,+Texas&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ll=27.644606,-97.844238&amp;amp;spn=6.809598,9.338379&amp;amp;z=6&amp;amp;iwloc=A&amp;amp;output=embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Harlingen&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Harlingen,+Cameron,+Texas&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ll=27.644606,-97.844238&amp;amp;spn=6.809598,9.338379&amp;amp;z=6&amp;amp;iwloc=A&amp;amp;source=embed&quot; style=&quot;color:#0000FF;text-align:left&quot;&gt;View Larger Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm guessing then that SW Air is offering cheap flights to a border town of Mexico because there‚Äôs a stampede of people looking to tempt fate and head into Monterrey to dodge banditos for some cheap black market Viagra.  (Actually, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs really for spring breakers heading to South Padre Island.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday - The Grammy Edition: Arcade Fire</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you watching the Grammy‚Äôs (or just following along on Twitter) and not familiar with Arcade Fire, winner of the Grammy for best album (not to be confused with ‚Äúrecord‚Äù) of the year, I give you the song that sold me off their first major &lt;em&gt;recording&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I‚Äôd like to note and ask, I‚Äôm pretty sure it wasn‚Äôt planned they‚Äôd play another song to close out the show, and the quote from the lead singer after winning, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to play another song because we &lt;strong&gt;like&lt;/strong&gt; music,‚Äù was one of the best digs at the Grammy‚Äôs I‚Äôve heard.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Inspired by @thebeardly</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewnorcross.com&quot;&gt;Norcross&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebeardly.com/&quot;&gt;The Beardly&lt;/a&gt; today with the quip, ‚Äúthis is amazing. enough said‚Äù, and I agree.  I‚Äôve been growing out a beard for about 7 weeks now, first time I‚Äôve simply stopped shaving completely.  Most people don‚Äôt even recognize me.  That‚Äôs cool too.  Anyway, inspired by The Beardly‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday: Band of Horses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs taken me this long to truly discover Band of Horses.  I‚Äôd owned Infinite Arms for a while, just hadn‚Äôt really listened to it.  Perhaps it was the fact that &lt;em&gt;Funeral&lt;/em&gt; is on the jukebox of my favorite dive bar, and the girlfriend of one of my close friends played it over and over after he committed suicide.  What ever the case, I‚Äôve recently been digging into their music and lyrics, and the vibe they put out really is speaking to me these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This live acoustic version of &lt;em&gt;Factory&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect example.  They were recently on Austin City Limits (The National were on the same show), and now I really want to experience them live.  Several years ago they played a SPoT show at the outdoor amphitheater in the Cuban Club, and from my porch in Ybor Heights I could hear them great.  The band shell seemed to direct the music right over the interstate onto my porch.  But I simply didn‚Äôt have the same appreciation for their sound as I do today.  Can‚Äôt wait for them to get back from Europe and travel the states again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bachmann Rewrites WWII History</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I clicked over to CNN this evening to catch the Bachmann response to the President‚Äôs State of the Union speech.  It‚Äôs the car crash scenario - no matter how ugly it is, you can‚Äôt look away.  What got me though was this line, ‚Äúyet this picture immortalizes the victory of young GIs over the incursion against the Japanese,‚Äù as she had the iconic image of the Marine‚Äôs raising the US flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, did I hear that right? The ‚Äúincursion &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the Japanese‚Äù? I rewound the DVR 3 times to make sure I didn‚Äôt hear her wrong. Nope, she went on to say, ‚Äúto symbolize all of America coming together to beat back a totalitarian aggressor.‚Äù What totalitarian aggressor does she think they fought back?  Hitler?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to the pundits afterward, the only thing they talked about was the oddness of a second, ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù Republican response. Or the fact that the camera that CNN used wasn‚Äôt the one that Bachmann was looking into.  DID YOU NOT HEAR HER REWRITE WORLD WAR II HISTORY?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought, maybe I didn‚Äôt hear her say that, and sought out to check. Nope, sure enough, CNN has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/01/25/sotu.response.bachmann/&quot;&gt;transcript of the Bachmann response&lt;/a&gt;, and it‚Äôs right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the video yourself, (do yourself a favor and fast forward to the 5:45 mark).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/xYqdKd2qG9o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking for this, I also read that earlier today she also rewrote some other American history by saying the founding fathers fought to end slavery.   You know, by getting them counted as 3/5 a person and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd be very curious to hear what a Tea Party veteran, particularly a WWII vet has to say about their official spokesperson saying they helped save the Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Epiphany: How to Finally Resurrect  My Cooking Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are probably 6 of you who know me either in real life or online who read my tweets/blog that know that A)I was a chef in another life, B) I have a cooking blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every 9 months or so, I get these grand ambitions to resurrect the blog, but my grandiose visions overwhelm the realities of my daily life, and they never transpire.  That‚Äôs not to say that I don‚Äôt still love food, that I don‚Äôt &lt;strong&gt;every day&lt;/strong&gt;  in my current profession as a guy who makes and manages web sites (do they still call it webmaster?) use my experiences as a chef, both in the work place dealing with people and changing focus at the drop of a dime, as well as the art itself.  It‚Äôs ephemeral, here today, gone in 20 minutes, a delicate balance between art and science.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/2658524899&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Still Life-ish&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3154/2658524899_0cc07183aa.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epiphany is, keep it simple stupid.  It may not surprise 4 of you 6 that I read weekly the Miami Herald, NY Times, Chicago Tribune, LA Times food sections as well as our local √ºber cool food writer Jeff Houck.  Not to mention the many tweets and links that come through my streams weekly.  I often want to share these, with a short anecdote, or comment.  &lt;epiphany&gt; That's what a couple of my favorite bloggers - Gruber and Kottke - do already&lt;/epiphany&gt;.  It was really the basis of blogging 6-7 years ago.  Then, just maybe then, I won‚Äôt feel the overwhelming (self imposed) pressure to write long form. Those can just occur naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question to the 3 of you still reading this? I should probably not push these to my regular Twitter account, right? I should just tell folks about the re-positioning once it‚Äôs done, and let them subscribe to the feed. Possibly create a new Twitter account to push those updates to those who prefer to use Twitter instead of Atom feeds for updates?  Should I link directly to the source article, ala Gruber, or simply link in the post with my anecdote ala Kottke?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And full disclaimer, I do have advertising on that site, that despite it‚Äôs languishing in purgatory, pays for a significant amount of my hosting costs.  That has nothing to do with my desire to kick start the site however, but just want to be clear, ads will continue on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Justin Townes Earle -Live Tonight in Tampa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When you‚Äôre the son of Steve Earle and your name sake is Townes Van Zandt, you‚Äôve got some pretty big shoes to fill.  Listening to his last two albums, especially the latest, &lt;cite&gt;Harlem River Blues&lt;/cite&gt;, I think he‚Äôs stepped into them quite nicely.  He‚Äôs playing live at the Crow Bar in Ybor tonight. If you don‚Äôt have plans, you should now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Olbermann - Baseball Historian Extraordinaire</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/assets_c/2010/11/TempleWilsonDetail-thumb-250x344-2542801.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/olbermann_blog.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I‚Äôve said it before on Twitter, regardless of what you think of his political leanings or on air persona, Keith Olbermann is one of the most interesting baseball historians/fans I‚Äôve read.  Regularly during the baseball season Olbermann waxes on both current and past baseball events on his Baseball Nerd blog.  I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve read a better example than his latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/11/this_just_infrom_1894.html&quot;&gt;This Just In‚Ä¶From 1984&lt;/a&gt;, showing a possibly never before seen page from a periodical of the time with images of a long lost championship game.  The fact he can give players names and anecdotes for many of those involved lends to the grainy images from a bygone era.  The juxtaposed image from the periodical with one of his own snapshots from the ‚Äò09 World Series truly brings the past and present of baseball together brilliantly (despite it being the Yankees).  I highly recommend subscribing to the blog if you are a true lover of baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transmit &amp;amp; Textmate No Longer Sitting in a Tree</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For years, my work tools/flow has primarily consisted of using Transmit for for (S)FTP, and TextMate for all file editing save for CSS files,  for which I use CSSEdit.  It worked like a charm.  I could be on 3 different servers, jumping from issue to issue, project to project, and never miss a beat. Now I know my hard core programmer friends will say I should be using something like VIM, which I‚Äôd love to be that guy, but my skills at modifying PHP would never allow me to work like that.  I like the code completion, syntax highlighting, and &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; GUI of a desktop app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this little work flow had become second nature.  I never really thought about it anymore.  For those not familiar with TextMate, associated files in a project open in tabs, ala browsers.  Otherwise, they are simply each a new window.  Originally I was using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/06/13/use-tabs-in-textmate-for-remote-files-opened-by-transmit/&quot;&gt;Muffin Research tutorial &lt;/a&gt;on how to get the temp Transmit files in a TextMate project.  With the excellent update to version 4 of Transmit, a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.taenzer.me/textmate-open-files-from-ftp-in-tabs-with-tra&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; surfaced dealing with the new way temp files were handled.  I followed along, things worked great. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a recent update to Transmit, I realized the temp files were no longer opening as a project in TextMate.  I tweeted about it, and soon after someone from Panic asked me to send a support email.  I enthusiastically did, hoping I had missed something.  Unfortunately, the reply was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi Michael, unfortunately I can‚Äôt guarantee that this functionality will return. It‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs supported by the ODB Editor suite. Really, this is a feature that needs to be added to TextMate in the same way that browsers can be told to open new windows in tabs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I politely replied that TextMate does have that feature, the associated files just need to be in a project.  Once again, the response was that I should open a feature request ticket with TextMate that files open as tabs regardless of being associated with a project, followed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We fixed a legitimate bug with editing files in BBEdit and this was an unintended side-effect.  However, it‚Äôs unfair of you to claim that this was a supported feature of Transmit as it relied on accessing a hidden cache folder in order to function.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an additional suggestion along the way that I could mount the remote servers using the built in MacFUSE technology as folders on my desktop.  I‚Äôm not inclined to use that for my work server however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I was offered a refund if rolling back to 4.1.1 wasn‚Äôt an option.  Certainly I do not want to be stuck with that version forever, but in the meantime I‚Äôve rolled back so I can continue on my current work flow, while investigating other options.  I‚Äôve downloaded Panic‚Äôs Coda application, which is an svn client, FTP and file editor all rolled into one (plus terminal).  I had tested it on its initial release, and didn‚Äôt find it anywhere near my existing setup.  I‚Äôve not used it enough in its current form to know if it‚Äôs mature enough to compete.  Certainly I‚Äôm not a heavy programmer, so a lot of times TextMate can be overkill.  I look forward to testing it further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, there would be a simple way for Transmit to store the temp files as in the past where TextMate can easily find them as a project.  Or TextMate 2 drops overnight and has built in support for opening files unassociated with a project as tabs.  I‚Äôm certainly open to suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, let me be clear.  I did not mean to imply this was a ‚Äúsupported‚Äù feature, rather it just &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;.  James, the Panic support person who corresponded with me over this issue was nothing but professional, polite and honest.  Refreshingly honest.  They make a great product, one that has almost seamlessly fit into my system without even noticing it most days.  I sincerely appreciate their offer of refunding my purchase.  That was never my goal.  I‚Äôve gotten far more value out of my purchase of that application to ever accept the refund, regardless of my ultimate direction.  I just want the perfect marriage back.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday - The Late Edition - Whiskeytown / Gram Parsons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was going through a really bad breakup about 10 years ago, a friend gave me two CD‚Äôs. Ryan Adam‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;Heartbreaker&lt;/cite&gt; and Whiskeytown‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;Whiskeytown&lt;/cite&gt;. I still turn to those two recordings when things are going bad. Adam‚Äôs lyrics and voice strike a distinct nerve with me, and is the perfect companion to a bottle of bourbon and introspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this video of Whiskeytown covering the Gram Parson song ‚ÄúA Song for You‚Äù, and it resonates for many of the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9hNExzwlhA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/AG7CQ0YugFc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn‚Äôt a video, rather the original by Graham Parsons with Emmylou Harris set to some great old photos of Florida and Georgia (Parsons was born in Winter Haven, FL).  This too struck a nerve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only in the last few years have I begun to really appreciate Parsons, but rediscovering this song will certainly spur me on to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a side note, the woman playing fiddle in Whiskeytown, Caitlin Cary is awesome in her own right.  If you haven‚Äôt listened to a more current project she‚Äôs in, Tres Chicas, or any of her solo stuff, I highly recommend seeking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Help Cigar City Brewing Keep it's Tasting Room</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/user/images/CCB.png&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Cigar City Brewing&quot; /&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cigarcitybeer.com/2010/11/10/255-the-tasting-room-needs-your-help-again.aspx&quot;&gt;plea from Cigar City Brewing&lt;/a&gt; came across my Twitter feed this morning via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independenttampa.com/&quot;&gt;The Independent - Tampa&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a perfect example of why I am going to start using my blog more and not just Twitter. Sure, I could retweet the link, say 3-4 words on it, but I want to fully comment on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nutshell, the Tampa City Council failed to make permanent the wet zoning license and extend the hours for the tasting room of Cigar City Brewing.  I‚Äôve watched enough city council meetings to know this is generally a no brainer for a business like this that has had zero incidents.  But for those that don‚Äôt live in Tampa or not as familiar, the owner of the CCB‚Äôs father has some high profile businesses that have clashed with the city for years.  These city council members are punishing the son for issues they may have with the father.  I know this because I watched the original city council meeting when they went for their license and zoning originally.  They didn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; that this would be a legitimate business. Or at least those were the implications. That somehow this would all be a ruse to get some kind wet zoning and turn into some other type of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little does the backwards uninformed who failed to vote on this know, but Cigar City Brewing is known nationally, internationally if you include Canada. Their beers are recognized and respected amongst some of the biggest and best micro-breweries.  Shutting down the tasting room, or at the least minimizing it‚Äôs ability to do business, is a travesty and yet another sign of how far Tampa really is behind the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are a craft beer fan not in Tampa, perhaps follow one of the links from the CCB site and tell a council member about your support for the art and the quality of the beer from CCB. If you do live in the city limits, please tell Ms. Miller, Rev. Scott (who is running for mayor? really you‚Äôd not want a world class business like this to not succeed?) and Mr. Stokes (oh, on second thought I will run for city council after telling you I wouldn‚Äôt) that not supporting this permanent license is a travesty and a disservice to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Less Twitter, More Me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first blog post I read about&lt;a href=&quot;http://leoville.com/buzz-kill&quot;&gt; moving away from Twitter &amp;amp; microblogging&lt;/a&gt; began my thinking of how I might do the same.  I came into the ‚Äúblogging culture‚Äù late in the game, so I didn‚Äôt have as much an identity as some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, lately I‚Äôve been feeling more and more my &lt;em&gt;microblogging&lt;/em&gt; platform of choice, Twitter, was becoming increasingly ephemeral.  I was conditioning myself to minimize my thoughts due to some arbitrary constraint.  Not to mention, I didn‚Äôt have my own reference point.  Sure, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com&quot;&gt;
Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pinboard.in&quot;&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt;, but I did not have a chronological reference to what I was thinking and feeling. Not to mention a real reference point of meaningful information I felt important to file away for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today launches a new direction for Michael B, one where I do not question if I can get my point across in a finite set of characters, if my use of UTF-8 character encoding will translate to other platforms.  Where I can come back a year later and the data will be mine, easily reached, in a database of my own management.  No worries if I post a picture if someone will sell it, if my words will be broadcast to ears to which I‚Äôll never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt mean to say I will not be verbose (which I am) or that I‚Äôve mastered some modern day &lt;cite&gt;Strunk &amp;amp; White&lt;/cite&gt;, rather I will not feel confined. And to which I will feel free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I will genuinely get back to the root of why I fell in love with publishing on the web, and hopefully make some, albeit small, mark on the face of web publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just but the first iteration of the new site. I hope to integrate some of the third-party services that I previously shared on this domain, and still feel an important way of expressing fully who I am, but I needed to make the move now, and fill in the important pieces as I move forward once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm quite happy this is &lt;strike&gt;(not valid due to old content)&lt;/strike&gt; HTML 5 with generous dashes of CSS 3. I hope to expand on both and as I learned my first go around with self-publishing on the web - learning is doing. (&lt;em&gt;Update: I was going to switch the videos to the experimental Youtube HTML5 embed code, however unfortunately the videos had been taken down. I also found additional typos in the same post. The home page is now currently valid HTML5&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beyond Barcamp Tampa Bay</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/riverspring/5028694522/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5028694522_b364c8b4d9.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This past weekend was the 3rd &lt;a href=&quot;http://barcamptampabay.org/&quot;&gt;Barcamp Tampa Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwords, Peter Radizeski one of the original organizers tweeted &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/radinfo/status/25640430439&quot;&gt;‚Äúhow do we keep the community talking between BarCamps?‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;, to which my answer was that I believe the key is to foster the ‚Äúmini‚Äù communities that come together at Barcamps, and that cross pollination amongst the smaller communities will keep the discussions going.  To which Peter replied he didn‚Äôt think the cross pollination was working.  I respect all of the work that Peter has done to help build Tampa Bay tech communities.  I think we move in slightly different ‚Äúmini‚Äù communities, so perhaps there are some that don‚Äôt cross over as much as others, but I will say in the 2 years since BarCamp 2008, I genuinely believe that it is happening.  Perhaps not as fast as some would like, but it wasn‚Äôt that long ago that I didn‚Äôt know a single person in real life working with WordPress, web development or web technologies in the Tampa Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was someone who had switched careers, was working from home freelancing, and all of my interaction was online.  I used to joke that I had more friends in the industry overseas than I did in the Bay area.  Now that is not the case.  Perhaps partly from the proliferation of services like Twitter, but I now know real live human beings living in the Bay area who work with similar technologies as myself.  That circle grows larger every time I attend a local event, be it Barcamp or more recently, the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://tampabaywordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress User Group&lt;/a&gt;.  I don‚Äôt get to &lt;em&gt;hang out&lt;/em&gt; with these people as much as I‚Äôd like, but that‚Äôs the case with my friends not in the industry too.  Life just gets in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think there is a responsibility for those who want to see a more thriving community locally to as I said, foster the smaller communities and try and bring the Barcamp sharing and nurturing mentality to their smaller circles.  Perhaps it‚Äôs time someone reaches out to Ryan and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://floridacreatives.com/category/tags/tampa&quot;&gt;Florida Creatives&lt;/a&gt; to start an active, local chapter to help bring the smaller communities together.  Maybe there‚Äôs another umbrella organization that just hasn‚Äôt been started.  Are people put off by the term ‚Äúcreative‚Äù? I honestly don‚Äôt have the answer.  I know earlier this year myself and several others discussed what possible umbrella organization could help achieve this, and nothing came of it.  Maybe it‚Äôs time to revisit the conversation in a broader scope?  I was speaking with an organizer of BarCamp Sarasota and they do events year round under the BarCamp moniker.  Is BarCamp evolving from the DIY stick-it-to-the-man un-conference into a ‚Äúbrand‚Äù that people can associate with and can be that umbrella?  Again, I don‚Äôt claim to have all of the answers, but certainly would love to see the discussion continue, and will continue to make efforts in my smaller circles to build a local community of web technologist for the Tampa Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shooting Manual with the Canon SX-20 IS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/4964990093&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/4964990093_6f51f336e8_m.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I picked up a Canon SX-20 IS several months back, but due to a variety of reasons, I‚Äôd not really taken it out yet and started shooting pictures with it.  Nor have I done much digital photography using manual settings, so today I set out to remedy that.  I‚Äôm a complete novice when it comes to fully understanding aperture, shutter speed and ISO speeds, but I‚Äôm determined to learn.  So far the Canon SX-20 seems to be the perfect place to start.  With that said, this is by no means a &lt;em&gt;review&lt;/em&gt; of the camera as I‚Äôm completely not qualified to comment on what is right or wrong with the camera.  I chose it based on feedback from a couple of amateur photographers whose knowledge of photography I respect.  They both had the SX-10, and based on the features and cost, the SX-20 seemed not to be too far from what the SX-10 offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/4965589398&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/4965589398_f2e3f5b490_m.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today I primarily tried to just get used to adjusting the f-stop and shutter speed to get a good balance.  I primarily stuck with 400 and 800 for ISO.  Having never used a digital camera to adjust these settings, it certainly seemed like a good starting point for getting familiar with the controls.  All and all, by the end of the walk along the board walk at Lettuce Lake Park, I was feeling fairly comfortable with the controls and adjusting the two settings.  I‚Äôm still getting familiar with finding objects in the viewer when trying to locate a specific object (like a certain flower or the Cuban Yellow Warbler).  Certainly something with practice I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get the hang of.  I also need to pay more attention to my light source, but for having not picked up the camera in several months, I think  I got a few good picks, which is probably more of a testament of the camera than my abilities at this point.  I am however confident that this camera will be a great learning tool as well as have the ability to capture some nice images.  Now I can‚Äôt wait to read up a little more on balancing ISO with shutter speed and f-stop, as well as just get out and take more pictures.  Next time I‚Äôm thinking about a more urban setting like Ybor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view a few more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/miklb/sets/72157624770529169/&quot;&gt;from the set&lt;/a&gt; of pics I took today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; These are completely untouched with any post processing. I really want to see the original image so as to compare as I continue to learn.

        <title>Jeff Norton Inspired Me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was  a quasi punk teenager when I first traveled to Hyde Park to experience ‚Äúart‚Äù.  Sure, I‚Äôd done the Ybor thing, but this was high end stuff as far as I had experienced it.  A live performance of actors was way more than seeing Black Flag do 3 songs then run off stage.  This was &lt;em&gt;School of Night&lt;/em&gt;.  I honestly don‚Äôt remember the skits, but I do remember Jeff and another actor doing a scene from a Sam Shepard piece (&lt;em&gt; I think &lt;/em&gt; it was from &lt;cite&gt;True West&lt;/cite&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I grew older, I took advantage of the opportunities to experience Jeff‚Äôs larger performances with troupes like  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americanstage.org/&quot;&gt;American Stage&lt;/a&gt;.   During this time, I was introduced to Jeff through a mutual acquaintance.  He was humble, brooding.  Everything I had pictured an artist to be.  I was jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought him an older but kindred spirit, not a celebrity.  He &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; an artist.  I got a glimpse of a genius.  Someone who was so comfortable with his art; perhaps tortured in the fact that he was such a craftsman of his art that he could perform it in a burgh such as Tampa.  He trusted that there were like minded souls who also parked their tent in this god-forsaken mosquito ridden peninsula of peninsulas a genuine art scene would evolve.  I know I cooked food with that same passion.  I regret I didn‚Äôt stay true to my own passion‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I for one apologize for being so shortsighted I didn‚Äôt realize it sooner‚Äìyes, I wanted a dynamic, brilliant local scene. And there is one. Theatre, food, dance‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all there.  Maybe not how I envisioned it because I wanted brilliance such as Jeff‚Äôs to be national news, and in my youth I lost my vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the twilight of my own perspective, and in the sunset of the passing of Jeff Norton, I reflect on that first night in a little corner bistro at Howard and Azeele, and pray that the baton of pure passion and art will continued to be passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God speed Jeff Norton, god speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Austin: Why don't you just try another neighborhood, all right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lee: What'sa' matta with this neighborhood? This is a great neighborhood. Lush. Good class a' people‚Ä¶&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;cite&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=A3mDkVrjhqIC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;dq=Sam%20Shepard%20true%20west&amp;amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;True West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(ed. note) This post contained two videos of Jeff, which have since been removed from Youtube.  I respect their decision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Second Thought‚Ä¶ Thinking Before Sending</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/miklb/status/18948707688&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Monday ‚Äúhaving a scratch text file to cut and paste stuff you want to think about before sending/posting/saying is one of my better ideas‚Ä¶‚Äù.  This elicited a couple of responses, a bit to my surprise, as I was basically saying it out loud to myself as a reminder to use this principal.  I have all too often fired off an email, tweet, forum response, or comment on a post full of knee jerk reaction, emotion and haste.  Only to regret it as soon as I hit send, wishing I had thought through the ramifications of the response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to clarify a bit on how/why I do this.  As I‚Äôve said, the main reason is if I have this unsaved text file already open, then I can quickly cut and paste the response to this file, move on to what ever it was I was doing before writing the response, and revisit later.  This is different than crafting thought out responses in advance of posting or replying, which as &lt;a href=&quot;http://seancoates.com/&quot;&gt;Sean&lt;/a&gt; suggested in one of the responses to use Notational Velocity.   I have well &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/note-taking-nirvana&quot;&gt;documented my love of Notational Velocity&lt;/a&gt;, and do indeed use it in this scenario.  These are thoughts that I ruminate over, that I want to save even after posting or sending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also didn‚Äôt mean to suggest that this was some ground breaking idea or that it might be completely original.  It is simply something that I have found works for me and prevents me from putting my foot in my mouth or worse.  It allows me to get something off my chest and get the emotional element on &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt;, but move on without any ramifications.  If after some period of time I still feel the need to respond to what ever it is, I can go back to this file, pull the relevant elements out the response, and temper the emotional aspects and pragmatically respond.  However, if after some time, I feel the response is unwarranted or moot, I simply let it go.  Having it as an unsaved file, I then figuratively ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù by closing the file without saving.  For what ever reason, I feel if I save the file, I‚Äôm somehow hanging onto these thoughts which I‚Äôve already deemed unworthy of sending.  Hanging onto these thoughts, whether figuratively or literally, I find unhealthy for myself. They simply are added baggage to an already overfull luggage rack in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thoughts on the Oil Spill</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3219733270&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3313/3219733270_1931ba7d34_m.jpg&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For those that don‚Äôt know me that well, I‚Äôm a Florida native, raised on the west coast my whole life.  Much of my childhood and teen years were spent in or on the water - fishing, canoeing, hanging at the beach and everything in between.  The Florida of my childhood is very much a distant memory due to the inevitable growth in population, however the beaches and bay still are very much special places.  No matter how bad things seem to get, an afternoon wading the flats fishing or a day at the beach - watching porpoises bobbing along feeding in a channel, a manatee grazing on a grass bed a few feet away, seeing an osprey fly by with a whole mackerel clutched in its talons - and my day to day worries melt away and I‚Äôm reminded why I‚Äôve never ventured far away from this part of the globe. (&lt;em&gt;Note, I observed all three of those encounters just this past Friday and Saturday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all of this is in jeopardy due to an out of control oil rig out in the gulf, spewing hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil a day with no end in sight.  So far, luck has been on the people of the gulf‚Äôs side, with currents from the Mississippi keeping the oil stationary for the most part.  However, we also know that this won‚Äôt last forever, and scientist warn that when, not if, the oil moves into the gulf currents, an environmental catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude will effect at least some portions of Florida, if not not the entire coast, possibly even getting caught in currents that move it all the way to the east coast.  Even if this doesn‚Äôt directly impact the Tampa Bay area, the shear nature of the migratory aspect of many of the species of the gulf, the oil spill will ultimately have consequences on my beloved waters.  And with hurricane season less than a month away, reports say the well might not be capped for several months, there‚Äôs no telling how a storm could effect things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been much discussion the last few years about opening up Florida‚Äôs west coast to off shore drilling, including allowing rigs as close as 5 miles from shore.  If this well had been that close, there wouldn‚Äôt even be discussion about where the effect would be felt.  We‚Äôd be seeing scenes on the news very much like the ones from the Exxon Valdez accident - egrets and herons coated in oil, shores awash in dead fish and sea life bathed in globs of crude oil.  That still very well may be played out somewhere along the coast.  How in good conscience then could anyone support such a move?  I think Bill Maher &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/billmaher/status/13089003490&quot;&gt;sums up my feelings&lt;/a&gt; on this the best.&lt;span class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;‚ÄúEvery asshole who ever chanted ‚ÄòDrill baby drill‚Äô should have to report to the Gulf coast today for cleanup duty‚Äù. &lt;/span&gt;  The facts are clear about how much oil is even in the gulf and how little benefit the U.S. would experience from such drilling, not to mention how far off in the future we would even see this minute impact.  In that amount of time I think we can find an alternate energy source that would have less environmental impact and provide the same amount of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a &lt;em&gt;joke&lt;/em&gt; making the rounds on Twitter today, &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;‚ÄúLarge Air Spill at Wind Farm. No threats reported. Some claim to enjoy the breeze.‚Äù&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;  I‚Äôd certainly trade a thousand windmills silhouetting one of our picturesque sunsets to avoid another catastrophe such as this one.  I‚Äôd just want assurances that Halliburton doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Twitter, Tweetie and What is Next?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to jot down some thoughts on the news that came out Friday that Twitter had acquired Tweetie, the mobile/desktop Twitter client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not a developer, so I don‚Äôt have any &lt;em&gt;skin in the game&lt;/em&gt;, but I do use the service, have paid for Tweetie for the iPhone, and am constantly looking for the &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; OS X desktop client.  Thus far, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nambu.com/&quot;&gt;Nambu&lt;/a&gt; has been my app of choice, suffering through the many iterations during beta testing to the point it‚Äôs a pretty damn good choice.  I‚Äôd probably pay $15 for it if were to come to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thoughts on the matter is that Twitter is still looking to monetize, they can‚Äôt go on sucking up VC forever.   Certainly selling mobile apps isn‚Äôt the way they‚Äôre going to go, they‚Äôve already said as I understand it that they will release the next version as free (at least that‚Äôs what I think I read).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs been much debate in the past about how this would happen, and I genuinely think they are finally preparing for advertising.  Certainly this deal had to be in the works prior to the iAds announcement, with Steve Jobs lambasting current mobile ads, and outlining that monetizing search on the mobile platform as being a poor business model, but it is what got me thinking this way.  Why else would Twitter be buying up mobile/desktop clients to give away free if they weren‚Äôt preparing to have inline ads in time lines?   Or offering a freemium model to have ad-free time lines?  I‚Äôm not suggesting they would use iAds, rather their own inline advertising.  Similar to how Twitteriffic does now in it‚Äôs free versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly this is all just conjecture on my part, but not one that I‚Äôve seen discussed in the fallout from Friday‚Äôs announcement.  Simply wanted to put it down in writing so I would stop wandering off on the subject every time I read about the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;
Well, that didn‚Äôt take long to come true - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/technology/internet/13twitter.html&quot;&gt;NY Times - Twitter to Make Money with Ads&lt;/a&gt;.  As I said last night in a tweet, it certainly wasn‚Äôt prophetic, as there had been much speculation on how Twitter would monetize and advertising was one way discussed, but calling it the morning of the announcement with little other speculation that I‚Äôm aware of, must earn me some kind of geek merit badge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems by snagging the best mobile clients for themselves, if they do wind up doing revenue sharing for inline ads, they cut out the middle man on a popular platform.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Note Taking Nirvana?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/dvortygirl/2445114424/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3136/2445114424_17c1d9d0b0.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;notebook collection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Like most, I‚Äôve struggled with note taking and mind dumping solutions.  I‚Äôm easily caught up in chasing the productivity pr0n, looking for the perfect system (hell,  I gues by writing this post, I‚Äôm still doing that).  At first glance however, with the discovery of my most recent set of tools, I believe I‚Äôve found the most streamlined, cohesive solution yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most recent excursion in a single note taking solution was EverNote.  Certainly versatile, perhaps too so, and it never felt like the right fit.  It was just too &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.  I wanted a no frills solution that I could easily access my notes from my desktop, laptop and on the go (currently using an iPhone).  Certainly EverNote fits that bill, but again, too cumbersome and too busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little while ago, I stumbled on a Habari plugin, &lt;a href=&quot; http://lab.morgante.net/simplynoted&quot;&gt;SimplyNoted&lt;/a&gt;, which interfaced with an iPhone app &lt;a href=&quot;http://simplenoteapp.com/&quot;&gt;SimpleNote&lt;/a&gt;.  Quite an elegant little app/plugin, I could take notes on my phone and be able to pull them up in a Habari &lt;a href=&quot;http://asymptomatic.net/2008/01/15/2688/this-is-how-media-should-be-done-habari-style&quot;&gt;Silo&lt;/a&gt;, and turn them into a blog post, etc.  Nice, but my iPhone isn‚Äôt the only place I take notes or want to do a brain dump.  So it‚Äôs lingered on the second page of my phone, starring at me, taunting me to use it.  Then the other day, the always with a great idea Merlin Mann, resurrecting his invaluable 43folders website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.43folders.com/2010/02/01/notational-velocity-now-syncs-simplenote&quot;&gt;posted a screenshot  and short post about his workflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, did I just read about something syncing with SimpleNote?  Sure enough, Merlin was espousing the virtues of an app he‚Äôd been using, and how it now syncs with SimpleNote.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://notational.net/&quot;&gt;Notational Velocity&lt;/a&gt; is a no frills, desktop application (is there a mobile, I didn‚Äôt look) that snycs with SimpleNote, quietly saving behind the scenes,with plenty of keyboard shortcuts but no fluff.  It gets out of the way and makes it easy to just jot notes, brain dump, or I‚Äôm sure in the hands of someone like Merlin, far, far more.  But for this simple guy, it was the missing link to being able to have an app on my Macs that did all the things that SimpleNote could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far in two days of using it, it‚Äôs been more &lt;strong&gt;usable&lt;/strong&gt; than any other system I‚Äôve tried.  I was able to bang out some thoughts before bed on my laptop, both gather links for this post as well as some outlined thoughts (yeah, this was actually thought out), as well as some ideas for some work I had to do today.  I was able to grab those notes when I hit the desktop this morning without doing anything, add to them, and then pick them back up on the laptop later in the day to finish up the writing I needed to do for my new job.  After dinner, I was able to then login to the admin of the blog, start a new post, open the SimplyNoted silo, and bang, all of my links and notes were there to write a post.  I can‚Äôt count how many events I‚Äôve been to the past year that I took notes at either in EverNote or with TiddlyWiki, but never got around to copying them over to writing a post.  I look forward to this being the missing link between thinking about blogging, and blogging.  Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Speaking of Flickr and iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/4291694316&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4047/4291694316_fc81b35548.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the birds&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted this to Twitter yesterday, but was quite pleased with how it turned out, and just wanted to post it up on this here blog.  I used the ‚Äúmagazine‚Äù option in the iPhone app &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nevercenter.com/camerabag/&quot;&gt;Camera Bag&lt;/a&gt;.  It was just before sunset, when this huge flock of crows flew into the neighborhood and lighted in a big oak tree across the street.  The neighbor was cleaning out his garage at the time, and every time he took stuff out of the garage and threw it into the garbage can, the tree would explode with cawing birds that would swirl around the trees.  I just happened to be sitting on the porch with phone in hand as it was happening and snapped a few shots.  I‚Äôm occasionally surprised by the quality of pics a mobile phone, and the iPhone in particular can take.  I still remember my first digital camera only being 1.3 megapixel and the size of a small refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sharing Flickr Photos on Twitter With an iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/4292825998&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4292825998_620b8db69c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tweetie screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As great a mobile device I think the iPhone is, there was one thing I couldn‚Äôt do with it that I wanted without fuss - easily upload a photo from the phone and post the picture to Twitter via my Flickr account. Prior to the 2.0 OS, you couldn‚Äôt even copy and paste a URL, but even after you could, it just wasn‚Äôt as quick and convenient as most tasks are on an iPhone.  Sure, you can use one of the 3rd party services like yFrog or TwitPic, which might be fine for a throw away snapshot you don‚Äôt really care about, but if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd like to reference in the future, or have control over how and where it‚Äôs used, they simply don‚Äôt seem like a good option.  I merely wanted to snap a photo, enter a title, tap a button or two, and the photo upload to a Flickr set and automatically post to Twitter.  Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenvolcanosoftware.com/flickit.html&quot;&gt;Flickit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn‚Äôt evident when I first starting using the app how to accomplish this.  Even after I explored the app and found in the default metadata settings an option to post to Twitter or your blog, I didn‚Äôt see how to actually enter my Twitter credentials within the app.  I then thought perhaps it was a Flickr setting, and looked into the settings for Flickr for the ability to connect to Twitter. Again, I didn‚Äôt see any obvious option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I emailed the developer to inquire how exactly to accomplish this.  Maybe it was just me, but the solution certainly didn‚Äôt seem intuitive, which isn‚Äôt usually the norm with Flickr.  You have to go to your account-&amp;gt;extending flickr-&amp;gt;your blogs-&amp;gt;edit.  From the dropdown, you can then select Twitter as the type of weblog you have.  Then within Flickit, in the aforementioned settings-&amp;gt;default metadata, you can choose to autopost to Twitter, in addition to setting defaults for title, tags, description, sets and groups.  You do have the choice within Flickit to not post to Twitter on individual uploads by altering the setting for that image, so you are not locked into tweeting every upload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can easily snap a photo, even from within the app, quickly upload it to Flickr, and it will post the title and URL of the photo‚Äôs Flickr page to Twitter.  Still not the same as a Twitter client harnessing the Flickr API and allowing you to write a full tweet, upload the image, and embed the URL like they do with the other 3rd party apps, but it sure beats using 3 apps and cutting and pasting a link, or compromising in choice of image hosting. Oh, and did I mention Flickit is free?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Food for Thought: Haiti</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/la_purchase.png&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Louisiana Purchase Map&quot; /&gt;Watching MSNBC this evening, the Haitian Ambassador to the United States reminded me, and declared to the rest of the country it was Haiti who helped the United States make the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase&quot;&gt;Louisiana Purchase&lt;/a&gt;.  The comments were in direct response to Pat Robertson‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0110/Robertson_Haiti_cursed_since_Satanic_pact.html&quot;&gt;despicable comments about Haiti‚Äôs ‚Äúdeal with the devil‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had Haiti not defeated Napoleon‚Äôs army in Saint-Domingue, the course of history would have changed dramatically.  We often forget such events, and take our country for granted, not thinking such a small country could have had such a monumental effect on our history and success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this bit of history aside, I can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs an American alive who would want to politicize and criticize the rush to help the people of Haiti (&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;, Limbaugh, &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).  I‚Äôve tried to do my little part after seeing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/servint/status/7723703494&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.smalldog.com/product/42760/donation-to-doctors-without-borders&quot;&gt;Small Dog Electronics was matching donations to Doctors Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;.  All I could think about is the families of all the people that I‚Äôve worked with over the years in the restaurant business, and what if it was my family.  I know they would do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>14 Days of jQuery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;jquery-logo&quot; src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/jquery-logo.png&quot; /&gt;I will never be a javascript ninja, but that doesn‚Äôt stop me from voraciously collecting bookmarks to jQuery plugins and tutorlals. I‚Äôve vowed to myself to become better acquainted with the library this year, and what better way than to follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery14.com/&quot;&gt;14 Days of jQuery&lt;/a&gt;? 14 Days of jQuery is launching on, wait, for it January 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, to celebrate the release of jQuery 1.4, which happens to also be the birthday of the incredibly useful, lightweight library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is particularly nice about this event is that it it‚Äôs being managed by the actual jQuery team, and not just some people looking to cash in on its popularity, so I look forward to the new releases, videos and tutorials that will be announced over the two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also doing a promotion where if you donate $20 or more to the project, you get your choice of one of several  jquery/javascript e-books.  Budget permitting, I may cash in on that, as donating to an open source project is always good karma, and a book would go far towards my goal of becoming more familiar with jQuery.  I‚Äôve got my eye on the &lt;cite&gt;jQuery for Designers&lt;/cite&gt;, which probably would cover what I‚Äôm most interested in learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iPhone Apps on the Cheap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm always on the prowl for cheap (read FREE) iPhone apps, and finding a simple source for such is no easy task, at least in my searches.  Unfortunately, all the sites I‚Äôve found that cover this type of information are so full of ads and poorly designed, it‚Äôs impossible to actually find anything useful.  I have however recently discovered at dealmac.com a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dealmac.com/rss/541-&quot;&gt;RSS feed specifically for discounted iPhone/iPod Touch apps.&lt;/a&gt;. I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve actually found any great deals yet through it, (I haven‚Äôt had a chance to play the recent ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Golf!‚Äù game posted today), but it‚Äôs a start.  And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have no problem paying for a quality app, and do so with perhaps too regular of frequency, but still like finding a deal when I can, especially on games, which I know I‚Äôll only play a few times, or very rarely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any sites or feeds that you‚Äôd care to share?  Tips on finding apps on sale?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mzingi Ported</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised this afternoon by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/mzingi#comment-4323&quot;&gt;comment left here on the site&lt;/a&gt; that my first Habari theme, &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/mzingi&quot;&gt;Mzingi&lt;/a&gt;, had been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolfcms.org/wiki/themes:start#mzingi&quot;&gt;ported to another CMS, WolfCMS&lt;/a&gt;.  Though I‚Äôve since passed Mzingi off to the official Habari project, and is now owned by the community and part of the official download, it‚Äôs a bit rewarding to see it deemed worthy of porting.  You can see a &lt;a href=&quot;http://adajer.byethost5.com/wolf-themes&quot;&gt;demo of it in action&lt;/a&gt; as a WolfCMS theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also nice they gave attribution on the official site.  I‚Äôd not heard of the project before, seems like a young project that is a fork of another CMS project, but their site describes the project as something akin to Habari.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy 2010</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/4233076410&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2704/4233076410_694d5724fd.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;resolution&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Perhaps I‚Äôm just a sucker for a reason to say things are going to change, but this little &lt;a href=&quot;http://moninavelarde.com/newyears/&quot;&gt;flash site to create your 2010 resolution&lt;/a&gt; spun one my way that dove tails into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/procrastinating-to-get-things-done&quot;&gt;last post I made on this site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the site, to ring in the new year I finally updated Habari, as it was oh, 300+ revisions behind latest commit.  Aside from having to upgrade a bunch of plugins from before the XML file as added and the info function removed, it went off without a hitch.  I also had to swap out a little code in the tweet template, but otherwise, for a script running off of trunk that hadn‚Äôt been svn upped since May, it was pretty damn painless, and a testimony to how stable it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have some ideas for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://cookingwith.miklb.com&quot;&gt;cooking site&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://h0bbel.p0ggel.org/&quot;&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; and his 365 days of photos in ‚Äò09. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congrats again for seeing it all the way through!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not a dish a day, but maybe one new thing from scratch a week with a post would be a good and realistic goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, may MMX be a shining path of peace and enlightenment paved with prosperity a‚Ä¶I mean, may it fucking suck less than 2009 did, and hopefully we‚Äôll get through it a little less scarred than the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikelietz.com/whine&quot;&gt;Mike Lietz&lt;/a&gt; for talking me down from the ledge I was on after I started the upgrade, and especially for showing me the handy svn wildcard command.  Most of the plugins I had were already trunk version from the Habari-Extra‚Äôs repository, but I thought I was going to have to cd into each one and svn up, he showed me I could do &amp;lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&amp;gt;svn up user/plugins/*&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; and it would step through the directories and svn them up. Handy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd also like to take a second to thank &lt;a href=&quot;http://shardsofconsciousness.com/&quot;&gt;Rick Cockrum&lt;/a&gt; for keeping the ball moving this past summer/fall on the development side of things, I‚Äôm really looking forward to digging into the new taxonomy system, especially as I build out the cooking site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Procrastinating to Get Things Done</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I‚Äôm writing a blog post about getting things done, yet my blog has languished in purgatory since early summer.  If it wasn‚Äôt for the three dozen or more daily spam comments crashing my database and clogging my inbox, I‚Äôd probably still be thinking, ‚Äúman, I really should start blogging again‚Ä¶‚Äù.  I do have a new design working in my head, so perhaps writing new content is a subliminal way of moving the design from within my head onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So not only in my personal web space is getting things done a struggle, like a lot of web workers, I endeavor to be better organized and consistently productive.  Lately, I‚Äôve been working on a concept that I‚Äôve been calling (in my head) &lt;em&gt;procrastinating to get things done.&lt;/em&gt;   Today, Merlin Mann posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.43folders.com/2009/10/22/who-you-are&quot;&gt;video touching on attention and creativity&lt;/a&gt;, which helped me solidify some of the core tenets of my theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started working from home, I started collecting RSS feeds for my reader.  Aside from ones that were obviously informational in nature, like the National Hurricane Center, most everything else I thought was vital to being a modern web worker.  43 folders was one, along with several dozen other ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Ñ¢‚Äù/productivity sites.  I hung on every list.  Likewise, I subscribed to every buzz word worthy site that was announcing the next great startup.  Now, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with these sites taken at face value, &lt;span class=&quot;pquote-r&quot;&gt;but my problem was that I hung on their every post, telling myself that I &lt;strong&gt;needed&lt;/strong&gt; to read these sites, as soon as they published.&lt;/span&gt;   That somehow by being up on who had posted the latest Moleskine hack, or which Google Map mashup was freshly released (along with signing up for the ubiquitous beta account!) , I was going to be a &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt;web worker. That these things some how validated me, made me &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;.  Truth was, I had no idea what the hell I was doing jumping into this profession, other than I was completely burned out by cooking, and needed a new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has taken me a long time to shed all of these sites (some more than others), and accept who I am and where I fit into the web‚Äôs ecosystem.  It has also taken a fair dose of following Merlin around the web hammering the mantra, ‚Äúmake shit.‚Äù  OR maybe I paraphrased that, but isn‚Äôt that the essence of the message?  Or is it &lt;u&gt;&quot;make great shit&quot;?&lt;/u&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pquote-l&quot;&gt; Anyway, I no longer try to validate myself by knowing who‚Äôs who and doing what.&lt;/span&gt;  I‚Äôve moved beyond the guy lying on the couch watching the golf tournament, and am out there hitting balls, playing rounds of golf.  I‚Äôve relegated to the fact I‚Äôm not going to be Tiger Woods, but I‚Äôm damn sure going to be club champ, or get on the Nationwide Tour, or, yeah, enough metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too belabor the metaphor, sure, I‚Äôm not lying on the couch anymore, but when I go to the range, I‚Äôm don‚Äôt always wind up hitting all the balls in the bucket, or it might take all day, I still allow myself to find timesinks.  Twitter is one that comes to mind.  Just as I had begun to cure myself of the feed reader ailment, Twitter came along, and I suffered a similar ailment.  I‚Äôve since pruned my follow list, however it‚Äôs still easy to get caught in just monitoring Nambu,waiting for the next 140 character nugget of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the point of this post, and my latest theory.  &lt;strong&gt;Allow myself to procrastinate for a period of time.&lt;/strong&gt; (For the two people who‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre starting to wonder how you‚Äôve made it, huh?)  My thinking is that if I just let go and allow myself to go read TechCrunch, or spend a half hour reading tweets and following links, then I‚Äôll run out of potential distractions and be able to really focus for a block of time.  As simple and obvious as it may sound, for me, excepting this has really worked.  I‚Äôm no longer trying to steal time to check anything when it‚Äôs time to get down to what ever it is I need to do that day.  I also don‚Äôt try to schedule my procrastination time.  I‚Äôve read of people who try to do ‚Äúrewards‚Äù, or work 45 minutes, do what ever for 15.  That concept doesn‚Äôt work for me.  When I want to just read and click sites and links, I don‚Äôt want to be under a timer.  I also do always have the right mindset to do it.  For me, I allow it to happen fairly naturally.  If I wake up and sit down at the desk, but don‚Äôt feel like starting to code out that design, as long as it‚Äôs not due that afternoon, and maybe even if so, I‚Äôll allow myself to read through all my feeds, and open any of the really interesting ones into tabs on the browser.  By the time I‚Äôm done skimming through, I often find myself excited about something I‚Äôve seen, and will actually want to get down to marking up a design. The next lull, rather than force may way through , I might then read the really interesting posts from the morning skim that are now in tabs, which again, chances are I‚Äôm inspired to take things to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What all of this means to me at the end of the day when I get up from my desk is that I‚Äôve made some shit without feeling like I‚Äôve had to chain myself to the desk.  Much as I used to love working in the kitchen, and it was nothing to work 16 hours a day without it feeling like work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My procrastination isn‚Äôt simply relegated to things I can do at my desk either. Depending on the week, I may tell myself that I can go fishing one morning, or leave early during the afternoon to go, without guilt.  I‚Äôve also recently forayed back into keep a fresh water fish aquarium.  I may take a long lunch and drive to the local fish store to grab a piece of equipment and just browse the fish and plants.  When I come back, since I had given myself permission to go, I‚Äôm not wrought with guilt, which just induces stress, which in turn leads to lack of productivity.  Rather, I‚Äôm fresh and chomping at the bit to tackle the next task.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/miklb/4018952415/&quot; title=&quot;10gal 10-17-09 by miklb, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2542/4018952415_e768f776dd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10gal 10-17-09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôve gotten further along in my experiment, I‚Äôm finding that I can actually stay focused for longer periods of time to deal with tasks that used to prompt spontaneous anxiety attacks which used to result in complete meltdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merlin‚Äôs video touches on these down times, and explains them as necessary distractions for the creative worker.  They allow to be mentally occupied just enough, but not so much as to prevent some higher thinking to go on, which can very well be a bigger part of the process of thinking about the &lt;strong&gt;stuff&lt;/strong&gt; you are going to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And indeed, if I were to classify writing a post that probably no one is going to read, but is something I wanted to do, it could be seen a positive form of procrastination as it free me up to start updating the code on the site, and wireframing the new design stuck in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>URL Shorteners, HTTP Referers and 301 Redirects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll start by saying I don‚Äôt know much about the subject, but am posting this in the hopes that someone who does can elucidate the issue.  My basic dilemma is that I have a short bit of code on my single page templates that checks to see if a visitor is from Twitter, and if so, show a little message.  (Not an original idea, I think I saw it on a post at Smashing Magazine).  The code they used didn‚Äôt work, but with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattread.com/&quot;&gt;BigJibby&lt;/a&gt; in the Habari IRC channel, I was able to get it working with Habari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I more or less forgot about it, until a few people noticed it and asked if it was a plugin.  When I replied it wasn‚Äôt, they asked if I could make it into one.  So it went into a to-do list I keep of Habari related ideas.  This evening I began working on it, and while troubleshooting how to actually output something to the entry single template (that‚Äôs a whole other can of worms), I discovered the code snippet wasn‚Äôt working.  With the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/&quot;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, we discovered the problem wasn‚Äôt with the code snippet, rather it was with the URL shorteners.  Twitter recently started defaulting to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly&quot;&gt;Bit.ly&lt;/a&gt;, and I recently began experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;http://tr.im&quot;&gt;Tr.im&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;span class=&quot;pquote-r&quot;&gt;both of which weren‚Äôt sending twitter.com as the referrer.  Rather, due to their 301 redirect they return &lt;strong&gt;NULL&lt;/strong&gt;.  Which in a nut shell sucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow Google Analytics is able to track referrals from Twitter, as last week when I had a huge upsurge in traffic from the popularity of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/infinite-summer-bookmarks&quot;&gt;Infinite Summer Bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôm seeing 50 visitors from Twitter the first day (of the 785, by far a record for this little weblog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, finishing the plugin seems moot, as the only way to be sure that visitors will actually see the message would be to use a URL shortener that doesn‚Äôt return NULL, of which, the only one we found that to not be the case was Owen‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://pastoid.com&quot;&gt;Pastoid&lt;/a&gt;.  I didn‚Äôt test Tinyurl, nor was I interested in looking for others.  The disappointment had already set in.  Besides that, if you are auto posting to Twitter with a plugin, you wouldn‚Äôt have the option to use a different shortener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So kind readers/stumble-uponers, if anyone has a solution to this problem, please enlighten me.  Meanwhile, I‚Äôll work out the issue with Habari and my desire to output content on a single entry template within the content output, not above the body tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in the snippet of code I am using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( parse_url($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], PHP_URL_HOST) == 'twitter.com' ) {
	    echo &quot;&amp;lt;h2 class='twittervisit'&amp;gt;Welcome, Twitter visitor! If this post is useful, don't hesitate to retweet!&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How About Giving Me Some Credit Hosers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôd think ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs best magazine‚Äù, &lt;cite&gt;The Walrus&lt;/cite&gt; would at least link back to my bookmarks if they are going to use my graphics in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.walrusmagazine.com/blogs/2009/06/23/dfws-infinite-summer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;post about Infinite Summer&lt;/a&gt;.  Heck, they didn‚Äôt even change the name of the image from the 5x bookmark file.  Real professional Nav, real professional‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least they didn‚Äôt just hotlink to the image in my post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Clean Home Theme for Habari</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs always great to see new themes released for Habari, even if they are ports.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.florian-fiegel.net/theme-clean-home-habari&quot;&gt;Florian has ported the WordPress theme Clean Home&lt;/a&gt; to Habari.  The theme‚Äôs name aptly describes the design, a clean, black and white two column design with contrasting red headings.  The theme seems to be coded for trunk, that is, using the areas feature.  One thing I noticed is that the theme still has some cruft from WP, calling for a dynamic sidebar (widgets) with some text that also references a text widget and and admin options.  I of all people can understand though of wanting to get something out before working out all the kinks, so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll update it as soon as the areas/blocks feature is fleshed out a bit more.  I also don‚Äôt speak German, so it‚Äôs quite possible he references that in the post announcing the release.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alternative Icon for Shredder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIXED&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/&quot;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; for pointing out the broken link on the download.  Now fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mail_TB_web.png&quot; src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/Mail_TB_web1.png&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Yesterday over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hawkwings.net/2009/06/23/roll-your-own-mail-stamp-icon/&quot;&gt;Hawk Wings&lt;/a&gt; they posted an entry on how to roll your own custom Mail.app icon, with a link to a .psd template.  I personally don‚Äôt use Mail.app, rather I‚Äôve been running the nightly build of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/3.0b2/&quot;&gt;Thunderbird 3&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time.  The nightly is actually called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/3.0a3/&quot;&gt;Shredder&lt;/a&gt; and is, quite possibly, the worst icon in the world, so when I saw the Hawk Wings post, I jumped at the chance to customize my icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure anyone else would care to change their icon up, but you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/downloads/Mail_TB.zip&quot;&gt;download my alternate Thunderbird icon&lt;/a&gt;.  Hawk Wings has a link in that post on how to change icons in Mac OS X for those new to Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Infinite Summer Bookmarks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/infsum.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;bookmark&quot; /&gt;I‚Äôm horrible when it comes to reading books and novels.  I think it stems from when I began cooking professionally and worked a crazy amount of hours, leaving me with very little free time.  What free time I did have was either spent  in a bar, or reading cookbooks and trade publications to further my knowledge base.  However, it also meant I got away from reading fiction in any form.  Today, my reading is solely relegated to reading online, and non-fiction for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer however, that changes.  I‚Äôm not even sure how I came across it, but a few people put together the idea of collectively reading ( a book club if you will) &lt;cite&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/cite&gt;, by David Foster Wallace.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://infinitesummer.org/&quot;&gt;Infite Summer&lt;/a&gt; is really a brilliant idea, and just another example of some of the great things about the internet and ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/infsum_bookmark.jpg&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;bookmark&quot; /&gt;I‚Äôll be reading along with everyone else, as well as with my fianc√©e.  We ordered our copies a few weeks ago, and it‚Äôs been tough to not get started, but one of the premises of Infinite Summer is 75 pages a week, with discussion along the way (the book is 1000 pages, which is how the 75 pages a week idea came about‚Äîbreaking the book into digestible chunks).  The site will have guest writers as well as a forum, so I really wanted to follow the guide.  The reading is to start Sunday, which brings me to the whole point of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äúofficial‚Äù schedule &lt;a href=&quot;http://infinitesummer.org/archives/168&quot;&gt;was posted on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, that is, what page number corresponded with each ending week.  It also will mark the cut off for ‚Äúspoilers‚Äù.  Nothing beyond that page will be discussed in the posts or in the general discussion area.  They followed up with a post &lt;a href=&quot;http://infinitesummer.org/archives/215&quot;&gt;How to Read Infinite Jest&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends using bookmarks, several of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got the idea to make bookmarks.  My fiance√© was looking for a way to save the schedule without having to check back to the website, so I figured putting it on the bookmark would be convenient.  A quick Google search turned up &lt;a href=&quot;http://asnailpace.com/blog/968/&quot;&gt;Stephen LeQuier‚Äôs 2009 Photoshop calendar template&lt;/a&gt;.  A few modifications later, along with some simple graphics to match the Infinite Summer logo (which itself is a play on one of the edition‚Äôs cover), and I had myself a handy bookmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be the first to say I‚Äôm not a print designer (some would argue I‚Äôm not a designer at all), so apologies in advance if the quality isn‚Äôt the finest.  My printer is in need of ink, so I‚Äôve only done some tests to make sure the size would be OK.  But I‚Äôm thinking that printed on some heavy paper or card stock would be sufficient to allow them to last the 3 months they‚Äôll be in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm offering 2 downloads, both in .pdf format.  A single version that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to be opened in PS with the layers intact, and a version with 5 on it.  Why 5?  Well, the guide to reading suggests multiple bookmarks, and well, I was able to fit 5 on a page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, perhaps others will find them useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/downloads/infsum_bookmark.pdf&quot;&gt;Download the single bookmark file.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/downloads/5x_infsum_bookmark.pdf&quot;&gt;Download the multiple bookmark file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any problems with the download, or the .pdf, leave a comment and I can see about offering other formats like .jpg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you haven‚Äôt already planned to join the Infinite Summer, it‚Äôs not too late to get to the book store and read along with the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;  Matthew contacted me and reminded me that in the reading guide, there‚Äôs a pivotal point in the book on page 223.  (No, I followed the guide and didn‚Äôt turn to the page to read it!)  What ever is contained within that page is apparently something that the reader will need to refer back to often and he asked if I could update the bookmark once we reach that point in the schedule, which is July 13th.  So on July 13th, check back for an updated copy of the bookmark for your main page that will contain that information.  I‚Äôll remove the June calendar to make room, Matthew says the information is quite brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all who‚Äôve commented so far, I‚Äôm quite happy to see so many people interested in the bookmarks and participating in Infinite Summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I‚Äôll be writing up a post on how I‚Äôm using &lt;a href=&quot;http://evernote.com/&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; to organize my thoughts and keep notes as I read.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Troubleshooting MAMP and Time Machine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/time_machine.png&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Time Machine&quot; /&gt;Well, it‚Äôs taken me what seems like forever, but I finally determined that MAMP has been the cause of all of my Time Machine woes.  Basically Time Machine would get to a certain point, in my case it was around 29 GB, and simply stall, not allowing me to stop the backup process.  I would basically have to restart the machine to get it to stop.  I originally thought it was a problem with the formatting of the external drive, however I‚Äôd done all of the troubleshoot tips I‚Äôve found on the web, to no avail.  Finally let me say, I‚Äôm not a Unix expert, nor am I that well versed in file permissions.  I know just enough to get myself in trouble, but I believe I understand this problem well enough at this point that I thought sharing my discoveries might help someone else avoid a similar headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nut shell, it seems that by default MAMP‚Äôs Apache instance doesn‚Äôt set a group owner for files created by the Apache server.  Time Machine chokes on these files, which results in a stalled backup.  After much Googling, I came across this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mirthlab.com/2008/04/05/mamp-might-break-your-time-machine-backups/&quot;&gt;blog post about MAMP Pro and Time Machine&lt;/a&gt;.  I then used the Time Machine options to exclude the directory that I created for my document root (I believe MAMP defaults to /Users/foo/Sites/).  Excluding my MAMP directory allowed Time Machine to completely backup my system.  In the aforementioned blog post about MAMP Pro, it appears there is a preference pane in the pro version to choose your user/group for the Apache server.  The free version of MAMP doesn‚Äôt offer this same preference, so I had to do a bit more digging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found was that in the Apache httpd.conf file, around line 327, the group was indeed not set, rather it read ‚ÄúGroup #-1‚Äù.  From what I understand of the Apache .conf file, using the # comments out what ever follows, which is why the cache files were being created as an unknown group, or ‚Äúnogroup‚Äù as the post calls them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I solved my issue by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changing &quot;Group #-1&quot; to &quot;Group _www&quot; on line 327 of the Apache httpd.conf found in Applications/MAMP/conf/apache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moving all the cache files that the Apache server had created in my MAMP document root to the trash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;restarting Apache in MAMP (there's actually no &quot;restart&quot;, you have to stop, then start the servers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removing the MAMP directory exclusion from the Time Machine options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all means, if there is any misinformation in this post, or you can shed further light on the subject, please leave a comment, as I would like to fully understand the issue, and as I said, the information might be helpful to others, as I haven‚Äôt found much on the subject in my searches.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dark Nova: Space Trader for the iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent countless hours playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://ticc.uvt.nl/~pspronck/spacetrader/STNoFrames.html&quot;&gt;Space Trader&lt;/a&gt; on my Handspring Visor, and don‚Äôt ask me why, but it was one of the first games I looked for when I visited the App Store.  At the time, there wasn‚Äôt a single option, though I had run across a blog post somewhere saying that a port was coming.  For one reason or another, I started poking around the App Store last night, and did a ‚Äúpower search‚Äù for Space Trader.  Lo and behold, there it was.  However, after a glance at the reviews, the $1.99 app got nothing but panned for not being a true port of the original.  (The original game is licensed GPL, source code available on Pieter‚Äôs site.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the search results, &lt;a href=&quot;http://darknova.net/Dark_Nova/darknova.net.html&quot;&gt;Dark Nova&lt;/a&gt; showed up.  Currently a free download, I grabbed a copy and damned if it isn‚Äôt exactly what an iPhone port of Space Trader should be.  Even the author of the original Palm version &lt;a href=&quot;http://ticc.uvt.nl/~pspronck/spacetrader/STInformation.html&quot;&gt;was ‚Äútruly impressed‚Äù.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with Space Trader, it‚Äôs quite a complex game with the goal of amassing enough money to buy a moon and retire.  In addition to trading commodities (including running guns and drugs), players have the option of going rogue and playing the role of space pirate.  However, running illegal cargo and pirating will bring about the wrath of the space police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now excuse me, I‚Äôve got some trading to do‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I‚Äôd love to see a screenshot of a Palm Pre running the original with the PalmOS emulator!  That would be a hoot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Firebug Add-ons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve recently been using Safari 4 beta, mostly because I had been too lazy to get more RAM, and Firefox was just too damn slow with all the apps I‚Äôd have open on only 1 gig.  Now that I‚Äôm at 4 gigs, I‚Äôve been contemplating going back to Firefox, especially with the comments I‚Äôve been reading about the speed improvements of the next version (3.5??).  Another reason I‚Äôve been contemplating going back to Firefox is that Firebug is just far superior to Safari‚Äôs built in inspector.  To that end, I‚Äôve recently come across two add-ons for Firebug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, &lt;a href=&quot;http://robertnyman.com/firefinder/&quot;&gt;Firefinder&lt;/a&gt;, is a handy tool to ‚Äúfind HTML elements matching chosen CSS selector(s) or XPath expression‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is one that &lt;a href=&quot;http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/06/introducing-page-speed.html&quot;&gt;Google previously used internally&lt;/a&gt;.  Today they open sourced it and released, &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/&quot;&gt;Page Speed&lt;/a&gt;.  Page Speed allows developers to ‚Äúevaluate the performance of their web pages and to get suggestions on how to improve them.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/thePrestige_screenshot.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Habari theme- thePrestige&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is just a quick and dirty post announcing the release. I hope to publish a more detailed post on the Habari blog detailing more about the the theme and it‚Äôs use of HiEngine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
It‚Äôs been a long time in coming, but I‚Äôm happy to report that I‚Äôve finally released a new theme, thePrestige.  Built entirely with Habari‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/HiEngine&quot;&gt;HiEngine&lt;/a&gt; theme engine, the first publicly released (at least to my knowledge.)  Many thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cockrumpublishing.com/&quot;&gt;Rick Cockrum&lt;/a&gt; for doing the heavy lifting on the Hiengine code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this a &lt;em&gt;‚Äúbeta‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; release, as there probably are a few bugs/quirks that need to be worked out, but for all intents and purposes, it‚Äôs fully functional.  Any bug reports or feature requests should be logged at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras&quot;&gt;Habari Extra‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; trac installation.  Patches certainly welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme also features a contact form completely built with Habari‚Äôs formUI, as well as uses the jquery &lt;a href=&quot;http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/&quot;&gt;tooltip plugin.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One ‚Äúfeature‚Äù that I intend to finish up is post author comment highlighting.  That is, styling the post author‚Äôs comments differently than the rest of the comments on a post.  The code is in place, just needs some CSS love.  Again, patches welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme has only been tested on the latest 0.7 build of trunk, I will work on making a version that works with 0.6.2.  Again, assistance welcome on this task.  I think the only glaring issue right now would be the use of the jquery tooltip for the comment form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habariproject.org/dist/themes/thePrestige.zip&quot;&gt;Download the theme&lt;/a&gt; from Habari Extras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can check it out from the repo at http://svn.habariproject.org/extras/themes/thePrestige/trunk/.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free Custom Handwriting Fonts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/chicken_scratch.png&quot; alt=&quot;handwriting font&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;How cool is this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poking around the web this evening, I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yourfonts.com/&quot;&gt;Your Fonts&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;FREE!!!&lt;/strong&gt; web based font generator.  The process is pretty straight forward.  You download the two page template (the second page is optional), and write your characters in the corresponding boxes.  They recommend using a fine tip permanent marker.  I used a fine point Sharpie, though I think a super-fine point might be better, especially if you have poor penmanship like myself.  Once you fill in all the characters‚Äîthere‚Äôs even a box for your signature, which corresponds to the carat (shift-6 on most keyboards), you scan the page and upload it via their web interface.  The fonts were generated quite quickly (though I do have a pretty fast upload speed), ~1 minute later, and I was able to download the font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the option of naming the font, as well as adding your name to the copyright.  Reading through their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yourfonts.com/help.html&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, you retain full ownership of the generated font, including the freedom to share or sell the font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend reading through all of the steps before uploading, including printing a second copy to practice.  My first attempt I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the guides, and the bottom of a few of the characters were cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibilities of this service are endless.  I don‚Äôt see why one couldn‚Äôt use the second, optional page for creating your own custom dingbats.  I could also see it being a quite novel thing if you had children to have them write out their alphabet and save it for posterity.  Any family member for that matter.  Imagine having your parent‚Äôs or grandparent‚Äôs handwriting archived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought it was a super cool discovery, and well worth sharing.  If you create your own, I‚Äôd love to see it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Habari Theme: Aqueous</title>
        <description>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I inadvertently forgot to remove tracking code from the footer from when the theme was deployed on my previous site, so I‚Äôm removing the old download link and updating the release.  Apologies to anyone who‚Äôs already downloaded the theme, you can download the updated version (0.3.1), which also has &lt;code&gt;$theme-&amp;gt;footer();&lt;/code&gt; added, which can be a useful plugin hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/aqueous_ss.png&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Aqueous screen shot&quot; /&gt;I‚Äôm proud to release my fourth Habari theme, the third port, Aqueous.  Based on an open source design by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixshootermedia.com/&quot;&gt;Six Shooter Media&lt;/a&gt;, this 3 column theme sports a fluid width middle column.  The original icons have been redone with custom icons that I created so there‚Äôs no issue with redistribution.  I also have restyled the comments and comment form from the original design, as well as a few other modifications for a working blog, but it still maintains the original integrity of the design, which I‚Äôve always liked.  It has that clean, modern feel to it, despite being several years old now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had originally ported this theme for a personal site when I first switched over to Habari, and have just never gotten around to releasing it.  Now that I‚Äôm not using that site, it seemed only logical to make it available to other Habari users, especially with the lack of themes in the community.  I hope that changes sooner than later, hopefully after .6 gets released and .7 starts focusing more on the theme engine.  I‚Äôm curious to see what people have in mind for it, but that‚Äôs for another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm releasing this as an alpha release, because I really haven‚Äôt tested it in other browsers aside from Safari 4beta, but wanted to get it out and see if there was any real interest before putting too much more time into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea that I have for future a release is author comment styling, as it currently styles the comments all the same.  Again, this will happen if I see that‚Äôs there is actually any interest in the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original design was released under a Creative Commons license, so there‚Äôs no chance of the theme moving to the Habari extras repository, so any comments, bugs, feature requests should be left in the comments on this post.  Future posts about releases will direct comments to this post.  There‚Äôs nothing worse than a site having comments scattered about the same theme/plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Habari Theme: Swanky 0.5beta Released</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/swanky_screenshot.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;swanky screenshot&quot; /&gt;In preparation of the impending release of Habari 0.6, as well as getting some to-do items off my list before adding more (I‚Äôve got two theme projects I‚Äôm either resurrecting or starting), I‚Äôve decided to update the ported themes that I‚Äôve released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, Swanky.  Not that I‚Äôve seen anyone use this theme, but I did use it as a base for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://cookingwith.miklb.com&quot;&gt;cooking blog&lt;/a&gt;, so it behooves me to have some updated code to make sure I‚Äôm using the latest and greatest Habari.  I‚Äôm not quite sure no one has (to my knowledge) used or modified the theme, perhaps the pink and black and &lt;em&gt;sexy silhouette&lt;/em&gt; isn‚Äôt a big draw.  But as I‚Äôve pointed out, it can be a great starting point for modification.  Maybe I‚Äôm just not aware, and there are scores of sites using it‚Ä¶then again, since I haven‚Äôt released a new version in quite some time, that could be a factor as well.  Today, that is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, this update is in anticipation of the impending 0.6 release, so unless you are running from svn, or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://habariproject.org/en/download&quot;&gt;nightly snapshot&lt;/a&gt;, this version probably won‚Äôt work.  For an overview of the theme, see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/swanky-theme&quot;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New in this release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed calls to jquery and and a deprecated Stack::out call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properly calling $theme-&amp;gt;tag rather than using the potentially exploitable Controller::get_var function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;updated the calls to check for logged in and added a tab to the top navigation for logged in users to admin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixing a CSS bug on long post titles so they don't cover the timestamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is considered a beta release, any bugs or changes will be addressed before the final release of Habari 0.6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/downloads/Swanky_0.5beta.zip&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloads/swanky0.5b'); &quot;&gt;Download Swanky 0.5 beta now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Habari Plugin: Pull Quotes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The plugin is now in the Habari Extras repository.  There is a branch and tag for 0.6, and a 0.7 branch for the new plugin XML format.  Any bugs/issues should be directed to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras&quot;&gt;Extras Trac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a blockquote, which is a HTML element meant to offset a quotation from the main text, a pull quote is a technique traditionally used in print to draw attention to a salient point in an article. &lt;span class=&quot;pquote-r&quot;&gt;Pull quotes generally take a small section of text and offset it from the article in a larger typeface.&lt;/span&gt;  In addition to helping highlight a noteworthy point, a pull quote can add a graphic element by breaking up particularly long pieces of text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pull quotes were traditionally achieved in web publishing by appending the selected text to the end of the paragraph and then styling with CSS.  The downside to that is that in mediums that don‚Äôt adhere to the style sheet (like syndication feeds), you wind up with the duplicate content at the end of a paragraph, which can confuse the reader to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, through the wonders of jquery, &lt;a href=&quot;http://css-tricks.com/better-pull-quotes/&quot;&gt;Chris Coyier&lt;/a&gt; whipped up a way of simply wrapping the desired text in a span that clones the text and floats it.  The beauty of this technique is that you‚Äôre not duplicating markup.  Any medium that doesn‚Äôt recognize the class on the span simply ignores it, and the article reads normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/&quot;&gt;Michael Harris&lt;/a&gt; who reworked the javascript, I‚Äôm proud to announce my first full fledged Habari plugin, simple as it may be.  You can see it at work in this post and on another &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/ie8-compatibility-mode&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Usage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upload pullquotes to your user/plugins directory and activate the plugin.  There is no configuration required.  To create a pullquote from existing content, wrap the desired text in a span with a class  of either &lt;strong&gt;pquote-r&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;pquote-l&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. &lt;span class=&quot;pquote-r&quot;&gt;Ut enim ad minim veniam&lt;/span&gt;, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Customizing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull Quotes has a default style included.  To customize the CSS, make sure in your theme‚Äôs header file that &lt;code&gt;$theme-&amp;gt;header();&lt;/code&gt; is called before the theme‚Äôs style sheet.  You can then add span.pull-left and span.pull-right to your theme‚Äôs style sheet and customize the pull quote to fit your design and tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Download&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/pullquote.zip&quot;&gt;Pull Quote version 0.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This plugin will eventually be handed over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras/&quot;&gt;Habari extras repository&lt;/a&gt;, however in my exuberance of writing my first plugin, and desire to experience writing up a detailed post for one, I am releasing it on my personal site first.  Once I test it against 0.5.2 to determine if a separate version is required, I will add it to the repo, so any bugs or feature requests should be logged in the extras trac.  Comments certainly welcomed as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Excellent Design Bookmarklet Suite</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I‚Äôve been contemplating switching to Safari, as Firefox still seems to be a memory hog, especially since I tend to leave my desktop on for days at a time.  With the improvements to the developer tools in Safari 4, there‚Äôs less and less reason for me to hang on to Firefox.  Couple that with this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Design&quot;&gt;bookmarklet suite of design/development tools&lt;/a&gt; I just discovered, and the excuse of having to use Firefox for it‚Äôs superior developer tools flies right out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suite includes a configurable &lt;strong&gt;grid&lt;/strong&gt; overlay, a &lt;strong&gt;ruler&lt;/strong&gt; overlay, a &lt;strong&gt;measurement&lt;/strong&gt; tool to determine distance between two points, and a cursor &lt;strong&gt;crosshair&lt;/strong&gt; tool (I‚Äôve not found how to use this one effectively, but it could be useful for figuring placement when using position: absolute).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt speak to how Firebug and the Safari tools compare regarding javascript, as I don‚Äôt do much with javascript, save using various jquery plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IE8 Compatibility Mode</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A post came through Twitter from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/02/19/ie8-standards-mode-opt-in/&quot;&gt;SitePoint&lt;/a&gt; regarding a recent decision by Microsoft and the IE team to add a new compatibility mode to IE8.  The post they link to is from December, and the IE Blog has updated the blog with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/02/16/just-the-facts-recap-of-compatibility-view.aspx&quot;&gt;recap of the compatibility view&lt;/a&gt;.  At first read, this sounded like a stupid idea.  Just another layer of crap that would keep sites from getting up to speed on standards compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon a bit more thought, I think it‚Äôs not a bad idea.  One of the biggest reasons I found people didn‚Äôt adopt IE 7 was that sites that they regularly visited didn‚Äôt render properly in IE 7, so they reverted back to IE 6. &lt;span class=&quot;pquote-r&quot;&gt; I think it‚Äôs still one of the biggest reasons people haven‚Äôt upgraded.  They upgraded once, a site didn‚Äôt work, so they stuck with 6.  A vicious cycle ensued&lt;/span&gt;.  Sites saw the stats, saw a big IE 6 crowd, and kept support.  The reality of business is going to say that some numbers cruncher is going to say it‚Äôs not economically feasible to update the site for IE 8, regardless of the chorus from the web team.  These are the sites that compatibility mode is geared towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding this compatibility view will allow people to upgrade to 8, still visit sites that haven‚Äôt been updated, but get the standards compliance of 8 for sites that have.  Sure, getting blacklisted as incompatible is possible, but a single line of code in the header will remove the compatibility view from visitors, and for those of us that want to build sites that are strictly IE 8 compatible, ignoring 7 (6 is whole different can of worms) is possible.  It‚Äôs very easy to tell a client, ‚ÄúJust upgrade to 8, and click the compatibility view option, your old sites will still work the same‚Äù, versus having to make a site backward compatible to 7 because people won‚Äôt upgrade or are reluctant. Worse, having to have 2 or more conditional style sheets to accommodate multiple versions of IE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say this compatibility mode list shouldn‚Äôt be built off of how a site renders in a beta version of a browser, and reading through the comments and glossing over the latest post I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the case, but again, I‚Äôd rather it be an opt in setting that allows people to view the rest of the web in a more standards compliant mode than having to wrestle as as a developer with yet another version of IE.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WhatTheFont for iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3271849725&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img src=‚Äùhttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3271849725_c0bc1882e6_m.jpg‚Äùclass=‚Äùright‚Äù alt=‚Äù‚Äù/&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;Perhaps not perfect, but certainly works (I tested it by taking a pic of my latest AT&amp;amp;T bill, it recognized the logo and returned Humanist 777 Bold Condensed).  I‚Äôve often seen an advertisement while out and and about and wondered what the font face was, now I‚Äôve got a fighting chance to find out.  Currently free and a .1 release,  one can only imagine it will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app basically allows you to take a pic, use your finger to crop the image to just highlight the text, and then it uploads the font to their server.  It then does what the web app does, compares the image with some kind of OCR and has you confirm that the corresponding characters are correct.  Once you approve the recognition, it returns the font(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty nifty little app if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hat tip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2009/02/11/whatthefont_for_the_iphone&quot;&gt;Inman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday: Lucero</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I skipped Tunesday last week as I was in a bit of mourning finding out that morning that Langerado, a huge music festival planned for next month had just been canceled.  I had been really looking forward to 3 days of getting away, and just seeing live music.  One of the bands that was scheduled to play is one of my all time favorites, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emusic.com/artist/Lucero-MP3-Download/11573841.html&quot;&gt;Lucero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered Lucero via a jukebox.  One of those jukeboxes in a hip downtown bar: dark, smoky, someplace you can both go to hang with friends, or sit and drown your sorrows as you suffer a broken heart.  It was during one of those times of broken heartedness that I first heard them.  It was soon there after that they came through town, and the rest, as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at the bar, throwing back a few whiskeys, and struck up a conversation with a guy at the bar.  We wound up buying each other a shot, listening to the opening act.  As the first band ended, he got up, we exchanged a few pleasantries, and he proceeds to head towards the stage.  Damned if it wasn‚Äôt Ben, the lead singer.  They proceeded to play one of those sets that you just never forget, and set the stage for me not missing another opportunity to see them live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with a lot of music I listen to, they have that Alt-Country/Americana edge, think&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;somewhere between the Pogues, Johnny Cash, Gram Parsons, and Tom Waits,&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; with just enough punk influence to not just have a twangy Skynard cover band sound.  Their early cover of Jawbreaker‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;Kiss the Bottle&lt;/cite&gt; is a perfect example of that synergy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm also a big fan of Ben‚Äôs lyrics, probably due to my propensity for finding myself in those melancholy introspective moments.  Lines like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think I'll stay right down here on this floor
Cause if I get back up I'll only fall down more
It ain't the liquor and it ain't the beer that keeps me down
It ain't the sad songs or heartache it ain't even this town &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the song &lt;cite&gt;I‚Äôll Just Fall&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;The beer tastes like blood, my mouth is numb
I can‚Äôt make the words I need to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had a weakness for writers
And I I was never that good at the words anyways &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;cite&gt;Nights Like These&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to suggest albums to start with, certainly &lt;cite&gt;Nobody‚Äôs Darlings&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;That Much Further West&lt;/cite&gt; would top the list, but from my blinders on position, you can‚Äôt go wrong with any of their recordings, and as I‚Äôve said, they are a can‚Äôt miss live outfit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of Lucero‚Äôs music is available on emusic.com.  If you‚Äôd like a invite to emusic for a trial membership and 50 free downloads (you‚Äôll have to give a CC#, but they don‚Äôt charge until after the first month), leave a comment with the email address you‚Äôd like it sent to, and I‚Äùll send one your way. &lt;em&gt; Shameless confession - you can do a trial membership without the invite from me, but if you were to sign up with emusic after the trial via invite, I‚Äôd get a 50 song credit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iPhone and Google Syncing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been well documented on the web already, but I figured since I had a few posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/99-dollar-iphone&quot;&gt;iphone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/calendar-syncing-lightning-google-and-nokia-e62&quot;&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; syncing, I figured it was worth re-posting that &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/calendar-and-contact-syncing-for-iphone.html&quot;&gt;Google announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that they now supported &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/sync.html&quot;&gt;mobile syncing with iPhones&lt;/a&gt;, among other platforms.  I haven‚Äôt switched from my previous set up &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, but all indications are that it is the same procedure, simply skipping the 3rd party, which is always a plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3rd party web services come and go; there‚Äôs little doubt in my mind Google isn‚Äôt going anywhere.  It uses the same Exchange server technology, so the same caveat that the previous solution had still exists.  You are only allowed one Exchange server connection, so if for some reason you are using it with say, Exchange, you won‚Äôt be able to sync your Google calendar or contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free LED Football for iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/mattel_football.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;mattel_football&quot; /&gt;I must have worn out at least 3 of Mattel‚Äôs little hand held football games when I was a kid.  Probably had another 2 confiscated from teachers for playing it during class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it‚Äôs no surprise that I‚Äôm stoked to see that there is a game for the iPhone heavily influenced by said handheld, and it‚Äôs &lt;strong&gt;free this weekend&lt;/strong&gt; to boot.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.touchgrove.com/&quot;&gt;TouchGrove&lt;/a&gt; is offering their version based on the game, (oh yeah, there was a sequel that was kick butt) until February 2.  Normally only $0.99, this seems like a great marketing plan, as they offer several other games based on similar hand held devices.  For instance I wouldn‚Äôt have known that they are working on a baseball game based on a similar handheld which I totally will buy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289808579&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;LED football from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Consolidating and Focusing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed resurrecting this blog over the past 2 months, all the while trying to find the motivation to start food blogging again.  However, the more I search for that motivation, the more I‚Äôm drawn to the idea of further consolidating my blogging efforts to this single domain.  It‚Äôs not as if I get a huge amount of traffic on my cooking content anyway, and what little there is, should easily migrate over much like bloggingmeta‚Äôs traffic did with a permanent redirect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea I had was to see if I‚Äôd do more food blogging by simply posting them to this site first, without migrating the old content, but if I were to succeed in my experiment, I‚Äôd find myself in a similar predicament in that I‚Äôd have no way to migrate back to the food blog, not to mention I‚Äôd potentially be penalizing myself in regards to search engine &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary obstacle is how to migrate the content.  I highly doubt my code-fu would allow me to write a Habari-to-Habari importer by myself, though I‚Äôve not even looked at any of the importers.  I‚Äôm not as worried about comments, so I‚Äôve got some too-ashamed-to-disclose hacks I‚Äôm contemplating to overcome the importing dilemma.  If anyone wants to help with this goal, I‚Äôll contribute as much as I can to making a formal Habari migration plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I were to overcome that obstacle, the goal then would be to design a magazine-ish style theme that would allow for sections based on tags.  As I find myself blogging more and more about the iPhone, I‚Äôve been &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/miklb/status/1157627875&quot;&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; that it might turn off the few readers I have.  Building on the tag based sections would also allow me to better offer tag based feeds‚Äîthough I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible to create a feed by excluding a tag ;-).  I‚Äôm sure I could easily redirect the feed from the cooking site to a /atom/tag/food (or what ever the structure is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôm hoping that one of the 25 odd subscriber/readers might have an opinion on such a move in both how it might effect me search engine wise, and what your opinion would be on having such a diverse amount of content.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Freshbooks, Getting Customer Service Right</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/freshbooks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Freshbook&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;First off, this isn‚Äôt meant as a review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freshbooks.com/subscribe.php?ref=ef40c79726025-1&quot;&gt;Freshbooks&lt;/a&gt;.  Suffice to say, I‚Äôve tested many of the online services for billing and time tracking; Freshbooks provides &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt; the best solution for &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; needs.  Often though i‚Äôts the intangibles that allow a business to rise above the rest.  For Freshbooks, their customer service certainly is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time during this past fall my Paypal credit card number changed, probably due to losing it, I‚Äôm not exactly sure of the circumstances.  Subsequently, many of the services that I use for business, (hosting, domain registration, etc) were effected.  In the case of Freshbooks, I was in an arrangement where I was sub contracting with an individual, getting paid flat rates for the work I was doing, so I didn‚Äôt have an immediate need to update the account, unlike say, hosting.  Plus, I tend to be lazy and procrastinate, so it was easy for me to put it off.  Each month, I‚Äôd get an email saying that the card had been declined, and I‚Äôd say to myself, ‚ÄúI really need to update that,‚Äù and then &lt;s&gt;forget to&lt;/s&gt;, blow off logging in and updating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended the previous arrangement earlier this month, around the time I got another one of the reminder emails.  They really are reminders, not nagging or harsh in the least.  I went to log in, and was redirected to a page where I could change/update the contact info, as well the CC#.  However, I didn‚Äôt know exactly how much I owed, and since I‚Äôm trying to stick to a budget for my web development endeavors, I wanted to know exactly what I owed and plan accordingly‚Äîpay it all off or make a couple installment payments.  Never did I entertain the idea of just starting a new account or moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing the next morning (I sent the email to support around 9pm EST, which they are on also) I received an email from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshbooks.com/our-team.php#laleh&quot;&gt;Laleh&lt;/a&gt; informing me that she had removed the suspended status from my account, rolled me back to their free account in which I could upgrade to a paid plan, and deleted my client list.  Mind you, clients and projects are never really deleted, rather it‚Äôs like a super-archived status.  At any time, you can undelete the client/project, and all of the information remains intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could have easily charged me for the months since the last payment or some portion there of, after all, they were storing my data and settings.  I was fully prepared to pay for this, as my time is valuable, and re-entering client information and setting up the payment gateway again would take a fair amount of time.  Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with the outcome, and an even bigger fan of Freshbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshbooks.com/our-team.php#sunir&quot;&gt;Sunir&lt;/a&gt;, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at Barcamp Orlando (which Freshbooks was a sponsor of, yet another reason to be a fan) posted an article on their blog today about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2009/01/30/google-proves-saas-is-hard-even-for-big-guys/&quot;&gt;difficulty of Saas&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;SaaS is not just a new distribution method for software with a lovely revenue stream. It‚Äôs a new social contract with the customer that we all have to live up to, whether we‚Äôre companies big or small.&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;  Freshbooks more than lived up to their contract, and continue to set the bar for how companies do business on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iBlogger iPhone App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to my discovery that you can post to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/posting-with-iphone&quot;&gt;Habari blog with Safari on the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, I purchased &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminex.com/iphone/iblogger/&quot;&gt;iBlogger&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone.  It‚Äôs from the same developers of ecto, a desktop blogging client.  It‚Äôs currently only &lt;strong&gt;priced at $0.99&lt;/strong&gt;, which for me is a price I‚Äôm willing to pay to test an app.  It supports all of the popular blogging platforms, as well as the generic metaweblog API, for which Habari has a plugin available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting the app to my Habari install was very easy, if I recall it even auto discovered the endpoint (example.com/xmlrpc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as functionality, I do not know if because the generic metaweblog API is being used, and sites using engines like Moveable Type or WordPress, but the options are currently pretty sparse (as of v 1.0.7).  Habari‚Äôs plugin doesn‚Äôt support posting images, so the only options really are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;adding your location&lt;/strong&gt; - the app inserts a link which opens to a Google map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;adding links&lt;/strong&gt; - an easy UI for adding a hyperlink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tagging&lt;/strong&gt; - this &quot;feature&quot; seems very weak.  It doesn't pull the existing tags from the site, a common feature in desktop blogging clients, and in my testing, keeps the previous post's tags on subsequent posts.  Might be handy if you expect to tag all of your on-the-go posts the same thing, but I don't see it that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iBlogger does support multiple blogs, otherwise, I have not found any additional elements.  For $0.99, I suppose one can‚Äôt complain.  Since all of my personal sites are on Habari, I haven‚Äôt had cause to look at any of the other iPhone blogging clients.  I understand the WordPress app is free and open-sourced, I‚Äôm sure at some point, most likely out of boredom, I will look at it.  Ultimately, as many people have pointed out, typing on the iPhone doesn‚Äôt lend itself to the phone being a real blogging device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However to get that in the moment feel, having a stable option with with a decent feature set would be nice to have.  Thank goodness with Habari and in iPhone, you don‚Äôt need a secondary app.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Posting With iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3234529497&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3122/3234529497_e526467896_m.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So I was looking at mobile blogging apps, assuming I couldn‚Äôt post directly from Safari on the iPhone, but alas, it seems I can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy cow, I can even post from the Flickr silo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kinds blows my mind. Certainly not a primary mode of blogging, but to be able to take a photo with the camera, upload to Flickr, then write a blog post is kinda amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit (not via iPhone)&lt;/em&gt; To be clear, my amazement isn‚Äôt in the iPhone, rather, in the quality of design and code of Habari that it just &lt;strong&gt;works&lt;/strong&gt;, even in the mobile Safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free Tracks from Amazon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kottke.org/09/01/free-music-on-amazon&quot;&gt;Kottke&lt;/a&gt; points out that Amazon has free music for download, and checking out the list, I see that the title track from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/favorite-album-of-2008-the-gaslight-anthems-the-59-sound&quot;&gt;favorite album of 2008&lt;/a&gt;, Gaslight Anthem‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-59-Sound/dp/B001DWXUZ6/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dmusic&amp;amp;qid=1233190289&amp;amp;sr=1-8&quot;&gt; &lt;cite&gt;‚Äò59 Sound&lt;/cite&gt; is among the tracks available for free&lt;/a&gt;.  Also on the list is a track from another of my top albums of the year, David Byrne and Brian Eno‚Äôs  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Overtones/dp/B001GH3JMC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dmusic&amp;amp;qid=1233190289&amp;amp;sr=1-4&quot;&gt;Strange Overtones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1233190277/ref=sr_pg_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;rs=334897011&amp;amp;rh=n%3A334897011&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;over 500 free tracks&lt;/a&gt;, though at quick glance, the bulk of the list are lesser known artists.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday: Pavement</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://satoridesigns.blogspot.com/2004/12/primus-sonic-youth-mudhoney-pavement.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/redrocks_92_web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ticketstub&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For my second installment of &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/tag/tunesday&quot;&gt;Tunesday&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I‚Äôd do a little reminiscing and highlight my single most favorite band of the ‚Äô90s, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emusic.com/artist/Pavement-MP3-Download/10514495.html&quot;&gt;Pavement&lt;/a&gt;.  Certainly it‚Äôs always difficult to say ‚Äúfavorite band‚Äù, or ‚Äúfavorite song‚Äù.  Heck, its often difficult for me to say ‚Äútop ten‚Ä¶‚Äù, but I can honestly say that Pavement is my favorite band from that time, and is still a band that gets heavy rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered Pavement in the fall of ‚Äò92.  Discovered probably isn‚Äôt the best characterization, as I didn‚Äôt know who they were when I saw their name as the opening act for the incredible lineup of Mudhoney, Sonic Youth and Primus (it‚Äôs amazing what you can find with a Google search.  The ticket stub, complete with the relatively cheap price of $17.60 is from that show).  The show was at the legendary open air amphitheater Red Rocks.  I had moved to Denver that spring, and this was my first visit to the venue.  I was only familiar  with Red Rocks from the classic U2 concert video, &lt;cite&gt;Under a Blood Red Sky&lt;/cite&gt;, but all of my friends in Denver spoke of it with reverence.  I was a huge fan of both Mudhoney and Sonic Youth (still am), and though not a zealot in regards to Primus like some, I had seen them earlier that year in a small club in Tampa and knew they‚Äôd be a nice way to end the evening and was really looking forward to the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Pavement were setting up to open the show, and they really looked like a bunch of roadies who were a pick up band to just warm up the crowd.  A bunch of young guys, with this considerably older drummer who came out, stood on his stool, and in one fell swoop, dropped to a seated position and kicked off the first song.  It was love at first note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pavement is now considered one of the trailblazers of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music&quot;&gt;lo-fi sound&lt;/a&gt;, along with bands like Sebadoh and the lesser known outfit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emusic.com/album/Slint-Tweez-MP3-Download/10910132.html&quot;&gt;Slint&lt;/a&gt;.  Often coming across as dissonant and harmonic at the same time, with intelligent, sometimes cryptic lyrics, their dynamic sound is infectious. (And that‚Äôs where I stop trying to sound like a music writer. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pavement broke up somewhere around the fall of ‚Äò99, but not before putting out 5 albums, and a slew of EPs, including my favorite of all their recordings, &lt;cite&gt;Watery, Domestic&lt;/cite&gt;.  As far as must haves, their first two full length albums, &lt;cite&gt;Slanted &amp;amp; Enchanted&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&lt;/cite&gt; should be in every fan of ‚Äô90s, American indie rock library.  Of the last 3, it‚Äôs decidedly split amongst fans which were better, with me being in the &lt;cite&gt;Brighten the Corners&lt;/cite&gt; camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Malkmus continues to record and perform with his band the Jicks, and fellow guitarist Scott &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúSpiral Stairs‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; Kannberg has recorded a couple of albums with the band &lt;cite&gt;Preston School of Industry&lt;/cite&gt;.  I quite enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emusic.com/album/Preston-School-Of-Industry-Monsoon-MP3-Download/10813493.html&quot;&gt;Monsoon&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the track &lt;cite&gt;Caught in the Rain&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled onto an interview recently with Malkmus in which he was asked about the possibility of a Pavement reunion, and he seemed to imply the door was open.  I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôd be able to recapture the magic, or if it would just be a nostalgic trip down memory lane, but either way, I‚Äôd be one of the first in line to see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/rhgQkoYGnjg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;ap=%2526fmt%3D18&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/rhgQkoYGnjg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;ap=%2526fmt%3D18&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/embed&amp;gt;&lt;/object&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pavement recorded all of their albums with the label Matador Records, and are all available, along with expanded re-releases of several of their albums at emusic.com. If you‚Äôd like an invite to emusic for a trial membership and 50 free downloads (you‚Äôll have to give a CC#, but they don‚Äôt charge until after the first month), leave a comment with the email address you‚Äôd like it sent to, and I‚Äùll send one your way. &lt;em&gt; Shameless confession - you can do a trial membership without the invite from me, but if you were to sign up with emusic after the trial via invite, I‚Äôd get a 50 song credit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iLife09 Up-to-Date Program</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So my mac mini took a dirt nap on Friday, (I‚Äôve yet to fully diagnose the problem, suffice to say it won‚Äôt boot, and I wasn‚Äôt able to find the hard drive in target disk mode) so I purchased a new iMac to replace it.  Unfortunately, iLife09 wasn‚Äôt installed on it, but I‚Äôd already read that I‚Äôd be eligible for a free upgrade.  Well, it seems iLife09 will be available tomorrow.  What sucks is that I‚Äôm going to have to pay the $10 for shipping and handling for the disc.  I can‚Äôt just go into the Apple Store with my receipt and get a copy that they will be dropping into boxes, even though I made the purchase 4 days prior to the release.  Certainly not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but as much as Apple prides itself on it‚Äôs retail experience, this seems to slip through the cracks.  Couple that with the less than obvious link to the page you actually need to claim your copy, and I start to get the feeling that they aren‚Äôt really making a priority to get the copy in the hands of owners of new machines.  From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/01/26ilife.html&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, it took me 3 more pages to actually find the link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ilife/uptodate/&quot;&gt;qualify my purchase and upgrade&lt;/a&gt;, which included going through the Apple Store.  Maybe rather than try to push MobileMe or a printer bundle, the salesperson could have provided me with this information?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beard Poster</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KYgjpL1TYxQ/SWr-EtMxm0I/AAAAAAAABV4/BqkqrCsiusA/s1600-h/Beard-Web3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/beardrevue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;beard poster&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last week I came across an interesting site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beardrevue.com/2008/01/beard-poster.html&quot;&gt;Beard Revue&lt;/a&gt;, and for the site‚Äôs 1 year anniversary, the author had created a print based on the classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/images?q=milton+glaser+bob+dylan&quot;&gt;Milton Glaser &lt;cite&gt;Dylan&lt;/cite&gt; print.&lt;/a&gt;  Something about the print &lt;em&gt;spoke to me&lt;/em&gt;.  Maybe I was caught in a melancholy mood thinking about my father, and how significant his beard was to me.  I‚Äôm not sure, but I ordered the print in one of those 2am browsing the web moments. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3222992778&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3222992778_f18e159065_s.jpg&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I got an email from the author middle of the week saying the print had been shipped, and low and behold, today it arrived in the mail.  I‚Äôd like to start buying more original art like this.   I‚Äôve been keeping my eye on &lt;a href=&quot;http://20x200.com&quot;&gt;20x200&lt;/a&gt; for something to capture me, but a site with larger, affordable prints such as the beard revue would be a great find.  There‚Äôs something about opening the tube and smelling the ink that creates a much more personal connection to the artist.  I‚Äôd also add the little touch of using stamps on the tube also lends a personal touch, particularly in this case, where several different stamps are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you are a beard aficionado, you definitely want to check out Michael‚Äôs blog.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iPhone and Video Recording</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While attending the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/tampa-mosi-tweetup&quot;&gt;Tampa Tweetup&lt;/a&gt;, I bumped into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sarahintampa.com/&quot;&gt;Sarah&lt;/a&gt;, and she pitched me on the virtues of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_you_have_to_jailbreak_the_iphone.php&quot;&gt; why I should jailbreak my iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main selling point: &lt;strong&gt;recording video&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the other stuff she pointed out, Google Reader syncing, tethering, custom themes, simply didn‚Äôt appeal to me. However, recording video sounded fun, all the while perplexing as to why Apple wouldn‚Äôt have a native app by now.  Anyway, I followed the links in the aforementioned ReadWriteWeb article she posted, and (with a bit of trepidation and guilt mind you), jail broke my phone for the sake of science - see, that sounds better and helps me sleep at night :-P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I expected, none of the other selling points passed muster in my brief exploration, and the initial video recording was minimal, yet still intriguing.  I held off on restoring the phone to further test video.  Then Monday, I saw a post on TechCrunch about a sanctioned&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/16/ustream-may-be-first-to-broadcast-video-from-unhacked-iphone/&quot;&gt; app from Ustream&lt;/a&gt; that allegedly would allow ‚Äúusers record and broadcast live video from the device‚Äù.  Certainly I was skeptical, as why would Ustream get through the Apple App Store police, but not &lt;a href=&quot;xhttp://www.qik.com/&quot;&gt;Qik&lt;/a&gt;.  Maybe quality of code, manner in which the app tapped into the built in functions, it had to be &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there were doubts that Ustream would be released in time for the inauguration, but alas, it was released on Monday at some point.  All through this, I wasn‚Äôt in any hurry to grab it, as I wasn‚Äôt expecting to be anywhere that streaming live video would have any consequence, unless you wanted to see me bring my plants in from the predicted freezing weather here in Tampa.  That was until late Tuesday I was reminded Alejandro Escovedo was playing here in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to test live, streaming video from an iPhone, albeit without an audience.  I registered with Ustream, downloaded teh app, and headed off to the show.  Upon arrival, I immediately realized that the released version I got only supported watching streaming video, not recording, at least I couldn‚Äôt find the option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn‚Äôt downloaded Qik, nor registered with the service, so as Alejandro and his band kicked it off, I grabbed the jailbroken app and registered via the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recorded (and I assume streamed live) several songs during the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object classid=&quot;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&quot; codebase=&quot;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,115,0&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; id=&quot;qikPlayer&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;sameDomain&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://qik.com/swfs/qikPlayer4.swf&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;quality&quot; value=&quot;high&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgcolor&quot; value=&quot;#333333&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;rssURL=http://qik.com/video/7ff6104c73e042618403029251670abf.rss&amp;amp;autoPlay=false&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://qik.com/swfs/qikPlayer4.swf&quot; quality=&quot;high&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#333333&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; name=&quot;qikPlayer&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;sameDomain&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; pluginspage=&quot;http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer&quot; flashvars=&quot;rssURL=http://qik.com/video/7ff6104c73e042618403029251670abf.rss&amp;amp;autoPlay=false&quot; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the audio quality is horrible, which most likely is the result of being right in front of the amps and the volume being maxed out on the phone, but indeed  I recorded some &lt;a href=&quot;http://qik.com/miklb&quot;&gt;video that went straight to the web&lt;/a&gt;.  Not wanting to compromise the enjoyment of seeing live music, I didn‚Äôt explore all of the options in the iPhone app, I titled, tagged, and described the clips once I got home, not much unlike how I‚Äôve done some of the pics I‚Äôve taken and sent to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/miklb/sets/72157612195223156/&quot;&gt;Flickr account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All said and done, considering the fact I‚Äôd never logged into or looked at Qik prior to the opening of the show, I‚Äôd say that the service has promise, especially if I can follow up on some tips on recording via the phone.  Ultimately, I expect Apple to release an app that works directly with iMovie, and then allow 3rd party services to tie into that.  Until that time comes, Qik is an intriguing option,  and worth the effort to jailbreak the phone, assuming one knows the caveats that go along with doing such.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tunesday: The Gourds</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I bring the first installment of an idea I had, Tunesday.  Get it, Tuesday + tunes = Tunesday?  OK, not the most ingenious idea I‚Äôve ever had, but since getting my iPhone, I‚Äôve been listening to a lot more music since it‚Äôs always with me.  And subsequently, I thought it‚Äôd be nice to feature some of my favorite bands, as a nice little break for anyone who wanders through, or follows me on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up in the installment is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thegourds.com&quot;&gt;The Gourds&lt;/a&gt;.  One of my all time favorite bands, especially live, I thought it would be appropriate to feature them as they‚Äôve got a new album out, &lt;cite&gt;Haymaker!&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gourds hail from Austin, TX, and for the casual listener, might characterize them as &lt;em&gt;country&lt;/em&gt;, however their sound is definitely more than that, despite the types of instruments they play.  (Ironically enough, I‚Äôve chosen an in store performance of a new track, &lt;cite&gt;Country Love&lt;/cite&gt; to feature from YouTube).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would simply characterize their sound as ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù, albeit with a definite Alt-Country/Americana bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was first turned onto the Gourds about 10 years ago by my friend Sandy.  Soon there after, I found a copy of their second album, &lt;cite&gt;Stadium Blitzer&lt;/cite&gt; in a thrift store of all places, but it wasn‚Äôt until she started working at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.munichrecords.com/&quot;&gt;Munich Records&lt;/a&gt; and gave me a copy of &lt;cite&gt;Bolsa de Agua&lt;/cite&gt; that I really saw the light.  I must have played that album straight through 5 times that first night.&lt;cite&gt;  Hallelujah Shine&lt;/cite&gt; is still one of my all time favorite songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, through the beauty of &lt;a href=&quot;http://emusic.com&quot;&gt;Emusic&lt;/a&gt; and Munich Records, I‚Äôve been able to collect all of their albums, and each has been a treat to listen to.  That said, their aforementioned release, &lt;cite&gt;Haymaker!&lt;/cite&gt; is their best since &lt;cite&gt;Bolsa de Agua&lt;/cite&gt; in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;295&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/YBXm1pId1vI&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;ap=%2526fmt%3D18&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/YBXm1pId1vI&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;ap=%2526fmt%3D18&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/embed&amp;gt;&lt;/object&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôd like a invite to emusic for a trial membership and 50 free downloads (you‚Äôll have to give a CC#, but they don‚Äôt charge until after the first month), leave a comment with the email address you‚Äôd like it sent to, and I‚Äùll send one your way.  &lt;em&gt;  Shameless confession - you can do a trial membership without the invite from me, but if you were to sign up with emusic after the trial via invite, I‚Äôd get a 50 song credit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Twitter: Reducing the Noise</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick tip to reduce some of the noise in your Twitter stream by only showing @ replies of people you follow.  I was a little surprised more people didn‚Äôt know this was a &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; built into Twitter. However after speaking to a couple of people at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/tampa-mosi-tweetup&quot;&gt;Tampa TweetUp&lt;/a&gt; who use Twitter professionally and weren‚Äôt aware of the setting, I thought it might be worth detailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic premise is that you only show @replies from people you are following to people you following.  This isn‚Äôt a per user setting unfortunately, however, it does reduce the noise, especially for those prolific Twitters with a lot of followers they are constantly responding to.  99 times out of 100, the response is of a personal nature or has no context, so its just a distraction and noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setting removes those, and &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; shows @replies to people whom you both follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the default setting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from the home page, click &lt;em&gt;settings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From &lt;em&gt;settings&lt;/em&gt;, click &lt;em&gt;notices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for @ replies dropdown, chose &lt;em&gt;Show me&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;@ replies to the people I'm following&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your new setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note you can turn off all @replies in this setting as well if you have no interest in messages between two users at all, however, I‚Äôve found that this setting is the best of both worlds, in that at least there‚Äôs some context to what a response is about and generally makes sense.  No more @so-and-so, LOL!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/twitter_noise.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve recently blogged about &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/cleaning-my-online-house&quot;&gt;reducing noise in my online life&lt;/a&gt;, and certainly this has helped immensely.  There are several people who I follow that have a broad network and use Twitter as a much more social application, but also occasionally link to interesting tidbits that I‚Äôve found useful.  If it were not for this feature, I‚Äôd long ago stopped following them.  Now for there to be a temporary way to &lt;em&gt;mute&lt;/em&gt; someone, for instance when they are live Twittering an event you have no interest in‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tampa MOSI TweetUp</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm very excited to be attending the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/tampabloggers/&quot;&gt;Tampa TweetUp&lt;/a&gt; this Saturday night (1/17/09) at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mosi.org/&quot;&gt;Tampa Museum of Science and Industry&lt;/a&gt;.  Billed as an unstructured evening for &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;‚Ä¶other local Tweeple who enjoy Twitter, blogging, and all that is social media for an evening of drinks and great conversation. Enjoy a night out of the office or home, Away from your computer, to dork out with others who share similar passions of social networking and have a few drinks.&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this a chance to socialize in person, MOSI is opening up the top of the IMAX dome, giving us an ‚Äúexclusive 8-story high, 360 degree view of Tampa‚Äù (hopefully I‚Äôll be able to get a few good pics), the museum will be introducing their &lt;strong&gt;Virtual Ambassador Program&lt;/strong&gt;.  From what I gather of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/tampabloggers/calendar/9377661/&quot;&gt;details of the event&lt;/a&gt;, MOSI is developing a viral marketing program by giving bloggers and social media persons some &lt;em&gt;swag&lt;/em&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One year free membership to the museum&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Free ticket to every IMAX film opening from January - June 2009 (excluding special engagements)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Free ticket to Body Worlds 3 and the Story of the Heart opening January 22, 2009 - The Original Exhibit of Real Human Bodies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in exchange for a ‚Äú6 month commitment in helping raise community awareness online about the museum, Body Worlds exhibit, IMAX, and other MOSI offerings‚Äù.  I have every intention in participating in the program, as I‚Äôd certainly enjoy attending events and exhibits and then blogging/Twittering about them afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/tweetup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tweetup!&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;In regards to the TweetUp itself, ever since attending &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barcamporlando.org/&quot;&gt;BarCamp Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôve wanted to connect with local bloggers and web geeks like myself.  To that end, I‚Äôve failed, as scheduling conflicts prevented me from attending &lt;a href=&quot;http://barcamptampabay.com/&quot;&gt;BarCamp Tampa&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a few local blogger meetups.  However, I swore to myself that this year I would make a concerted effort to be available for these events, as well as actively help foster more of them.  I read with envy tweets from people in places like Philadelphia and Orlando who are connecting in real life with other bloggers and developers. I don‚Äôt want to wait until I‚Äôm in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogorlando.com/&quot;&gt;different city&lt;/a&gt; to meet and connect with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sarahintampa.com/&quot;&gt;folks who live down the road&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I don‚Äôt consider myself a big ‚Äúsocial networker‚Äù, I do &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/why-twitter-is-just-em-cool-em&quot;&gt;love me some Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and certainly understand their place in today‚Äôs web.  I am actually taking my first steps in embracing a broader view of social networking by integrating some of the features available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php&quot;&gt;Facebook Connect&lt;/a&gt; into a site I‚Äôm developing for a client.  I‚Äôve got a long way to go, but it‚Äôs certainly been an enlightening process, and has undeniably changed my attitude towards sites like Facebook in that just because I personally do not participate in a particular network, it doesn‚Äôt mean the network has no value.  That said, I don‚Äôt think I will ever say the same thing about MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Comment Feed Fixed</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Little did I know that I needed to create a separate feed for comments at Feedburner for it to actually work with the Feedburner plugin for Habari.  So if for some reason you wanted to subscribe to site wide comments vs a single post, it‚Äôs now working.  I‚Äôve also added recent comments to the sidebar, complete with a spiffy excerpt of the comment.  Thanks to whomever created the summarize function, it only took a PHP n00b like myself a couple of minutes to figure out how to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Recent_Comments&quot;&gt;separate comment content excerpt in Habari&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Protecting the iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally made it out of the house after a week of being holed up sick, and stopped off to get a case for the iPhone.  First stop was the Apple store, only to be terribly disappointed with the selection.  I did however pick up some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.powersupportusa.com/products/iphone3G_antiglare.php&quot;&gt;anti-glare film&lt;/a&gt;, which as advertised ‚Äúprovides traction for improved responsiveness‚Äù.  I was worried about bubbles, but it applied just fine, with only one small bubble, however the anti-glare totally hides it when the phone is on.  From there, I hit Best Buy and grabbed an inexpensive, utilitarian &lt;a href=&quot;http://rocketfishproducts.com/pc-110-7-rocketfish-silicone-case-for-apple-iphone.aspx&quot;&gt;silicone case&lt;/a&gt;.  It‚Äôs quite sufficient for now, at least until I get a dock, not sure it would fit in one, though it‚Äôs a fairly thin sleeve.  I‚Äôd highly recommend the anti-glare film to any iPhone user.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Writing Style for Blogs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, &lt;a href=&quot;http://asymptomatic.net/2009/01/10/2780/why-cant-it&quot;&gt;Owen writes about his blogging style&lt;/a&gt;; I was remarking the other night that no wonder no one reads my blog, the posts are too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been trying to blog more, but tend to write these long diatribes, which smack against the conventions of online writing that I‚Äôve read.  I used to tell myself that I blogged for my own benefit, and that I didn‚Äôt care if anyone read it, but I‚Äôm fooling myself.  Every time I write something, I find myself checking stats and looking for comments, so obviously I do care. To that end I am also looking to tailor my blogging style to cater to easier digestion, regular readership and the potential for a discussion to ensue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2008/03/15/21/&quot;&gt;few references&lt;/a&gt; (actually, Bleacher Report has quite a bit of good reference, be it sports related or not), but am looking for more.  Do you have any quality references for online writing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; - I‚Äôve found a few links that have some good information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A collection of articles by&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/&quot;&gt; Jakob Nielsen on writing for the web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually linked from the previous set of articles, but worthy of listing again, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.e-gineer.com/v1/articles/web-writing-for-many-interest-levels.htm&quot;&gt;web writing for many interest levels&lt;/a&gt;, is very informative.  I particularly like the methodology list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/contribute/styleguide/&quot;&gt;A List Apart's style guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll update this list as I find additional resources.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Headline Right Out of The Wire</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a case of life imitating art imitating life &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/baltimore_city/bal-md.ci.indict10jan10,0,48597.story&quot;&gt;the Baltimore mayor was indicted&lt;/a&gt; on 12 counts of felony theft, perjury, fraud and misconduct in office.  I can see Lester Freeman and his crew heading the investigation, Bunk and McNulty laughing about the headlines as they pass a bottle of Jameson‚Äôs in an empty lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from reading the article, it sounds like the mayor and her attorney are taking pages right out of the Clay Davis/Clarence Royce playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, that was a great show, I really look forward to another project from Simon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Color of the Year</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/jpellgen/443788491/&quot; alt=&quot;mimosa&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/443788491_68b9cecb55_m.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In doing some research for design trends in 2009, I stumbled upon Pantone‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/pantone.aspx?pg=20634&amp;amp;ca=10&quot;&gt;2009 color of the year&lt;/a&gt;.  PANTONE¬Æ 14-0848 Mimosa, a ‚Äúwarm, engaging yellow‚Ä¶no other color expresses hope and reassurance more than yellow‚Äù.  Interestingly enough, COLOURlovers has relatively few palettes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/search?hsv=&amp;amp;sortType=ts&amp;amp;sortBy=desc&amp;amp;query=mimosa&amp;amp;hex=&amp;amp;lover=&amp;amp;hueOption0=&amp;amp;hueOption1=&amp;amp;hueOption2=&amp;amp;publishedBeginDate=12%2F27%2F2004&amp;amp;publishedEndDate=01%2F09%2F2009&amp;amp;x=29&amp;amp;y=7&quot;&gt;tagged mimosa&lt;/a&gt;, and of those few are inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll admit color and color theory aren‚Äôt my strong suit, I tend to rely on Color Schemer Studio and sites like COLOURlovers.  I did put together this palatte based on mimosa.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Late to the Party‚ÄîMy 99 Dollar iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3182996039&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3407/3182996039_1eb840cec2_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Though the fact that most who know me consider me to be a ‚ÄúMac fan boy‚Äù, over the years I‚Äôve become quite the hesitant buyer due to the common malady of being always afraid of a new and better version being right around the corner.  Add to that my disdain for the requirement of signing a long term contract with cell phone carriers, I have been living with antiquated mobile technology.  That is, until AT&amp;amp;T offered $99 refurbished 8 gig 3G  iPhones in a post Christmas promotion (the offer was only good through 12/31/08).  I figured at that price, no matter what might come around the corner, I wouldn‚Äôt feel bitten if a new model came out 3 months after buying.  Couple that with the fact that the non-contract plan I had with AT&amp;amp;T was creeping up close to the lowest iPhone plan, I took the plunge.  The phone arrived already set up, much to my surprise.  I didn‚Äôt have to go through any registration to speak of, I plugged it in, named it, updated the software, and it was ready to go.  The phone came with the standard headphones, the USB connector, the wall charger attachment, and I would have never known it was a refurbished item aesthetically.  The refurbished phone even has the same 1 year warranty that a new iPhone comes with.  I haven‚Äôt checked on extending the warranty with Apple Care; I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Primary Hurdle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/ushlambad/1047117363/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1114/1047117363_2a05422ae8_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hurdle&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As I‚Äôve &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/calendar-syncing-lightning-google-and-nokia-e62&quot;&gt;blogged about recently, &lt;/a&gt;, I have been using Thunderbird 3.0 and the nightly build of Lightning calendar extension, and didn‚Äôt want to change that system.  The same issues that I had with the Nokia are present with the iPhone.  However, goosync wasn‚Äôt an option for the iPhone.  Something to do with Apple not allowing access to the built in calendar.  Some extensive Googling didn‚Äôt turn up many options, save using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuevasync.com/&quot;&gt;NuevaSync&lt;/a&gt;, yet another 3rd party ‚Äúbeta‚Äù service.  Some of the initial concerns people had with NuevaSync were sharing their Google username and password, however that‚Äôs long since been remedied, as they use Google account authentication.  Meaning, once you register with Nuevasync, you only provide your Google user name, and Google will authenticate your account with the Nuevasync account, no password is ever passed to Nuevasync.  The only downside is if you are already using an Exchange account (for email for instance), you will not be able to also use Nuevasync, as the iPhone only supports one Exchange server synchronization.  Set up for Nuevasync is well documented on their site, straight forward and very simple.  I did have a bit of trouble actually getting the iPhone calendar to sync with my Google calendar, and quite honestly, I‚Äôm not sure what I did to finally get it to sync.  Disabling, then re-enabling the account might have been the trick, but as I‚Äôve been suffering a cold, it could have been user error, however, within their documentation, they have several troubleshooting tips and nothing I did was outside their suggestions..  Needless to say, my iPhone calendar is synced to my Google Apps calendar, desktop iCal, and Thunderbird 3.0/Lighting 1.0pre.  Unlike with goosync and my Nokia, there is no need to manually sync the calendars.  Nuevsnyc also supports sync contacts within your Google account, but I have no need to use that service, as I also believe iSync supports Google contact syncing (something I‚Äôve kvetched about previously in that you have to have an iPhone/iPod to enable that feature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving from calendar, next was email.  I had previously used Apple Mail.app with my Google Apps IMAP accounts, so they synced directly to the phone on first sync.  I did need to modify some advanced settings regarding mailboxes for things like drafts and sent mail, but that‚Äôs common when setting up IMAP accounts and email clients.  Google has well documented the settings, so I won‚Äôt rehash the obvious.  Previously I was using Google‚Äôs mobile mail app on the Nokia, and was a bit hesitant about using the native mail client, but so far I‚Äôve been quite pleased with it, and have no qualms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syncing my contacts, along with email addresses in my Google Apps account was also a seamless process.  It also the catalyst I needed to do a much needed cleaning of my address book.  I‚Äôve been a user of the (neglected) Google service &lt;a href=&quot;http://grandcentral.com/&quot;&gt;Grand Central&lt;/a&gt; for some time now, and though it‚Äôs a handy one, it‚Äôs support for mobile devices leaves more than something to be desired.  My only attempt to play a voice message via their mobile site failed to play the .mp3, and from previous use on the Nokia, is all but useless.  However, I found a handy iPhone app, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ggtenterprises.com/products/granddialer/&quot;&gt;Grand Dialer&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to call a contact directly from your address book with your Grand Central number, so for the occasion you need to call a client and do not want to expose your personal cell number, you‚Äôre covered.  (Google, if you are listening, please, no, make that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pretty please&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; give Grand Central some love, even if that means a nominal monthly fee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIke any new iPhone user, I spent a fair amount of time perusing the App Store.  Again, I won‚Äôt rehash the obvious and common popular apps.  I didn‚Äôt really test any of the alternatives to the mobile versions of the desktop apps I knew I wanted.  As I use NetNewsWire on the desktop, it was an obvious choice for the iPhone.  My unread feeds are synced with my desktop, so I‚Äôm never reading feeds I‚Äôve already read.  Also, for Twitter, I simply chose the ad supported version of Twitterific, same as on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Camera&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3183796430&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3318/3183796430_d047f65326_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I‚Äôd become accustomed to being one of the few people left on the planet to not have a camera on their cell phone, and didn‚Äôt think it would be something I‚Äôd take much interest in now that I did, but I did explore some of the apps available.  Merlin Mann blogged about&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/67192250/smoke-break-by-merlinmann-ive-been-trying-to&quot;&gt;taking pictures with his iphone&lt;/a&gt;right about the time I ordered my phone, so I booked marked the app he mentioned, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nevercenter.com/camerabag/&quot;&gt;Camera Bag&lt;/a&gt;.  It was actually the first app I purchased.  My next search for was for an app that would allow me to upload my camera shots to Flickr.  Flickr does have the native ability to email photos directly, however the combination of the email client and Flickr (not sure which does it), the images are resized to 640x480.  Granted if you get a really good shot and want to post the bigger one, you‚Äôve got the image on the camera, could snyc it to iPhoto, and then upload it, but if an app could save that step, why not give it a shot?  So far, the free &lt;a href=&quot;http://klickmap.com/&quot;&gt;Klick&lt;/a&gt; app seems to fit the bill.  Due to the aforementioned cold, I‚Äôve not really explored the Klick too extensively, but I was able to upload a full size image via the 3G network with no problems, though I haven‚Äôt figured out if I can add an image to a set via the app.  The other app I‚Äôve download is &lt;a href=&quot;itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=298256007&amp;amp;mt=8 &quot;&gt;Dark Room&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;App Store link&lt;/em&gt;).  This app uses the accelerometer for a ‚Äústeady cam‚Äù.  Basically it waits until the camera isn‚Äôt moving to snap the pic, which is handy for low light situations.  A case I‚Äôm curious about is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/clarifi&quot;&gt;the Griffin Clarifi&lt;/a&gt;, which has a built in macro like lens for taking close up shots.  Apparently the iPhone lens doesn‚Äôt do well at focusing below twelve inches.  This would be handy as the technology and apps evolve on snapping UPC codes and doing info/price comparison queries.  Also for going paperless, and just snapping business cards, receipts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I struggle with being organized and actually productive, and often fall into the trap of perpetually tweaking a system, rather than actually getting things done.  I‚Äôve yet to find the right piece of software that just fits, seemingly having tried them all, Actiontastic, Omni Focus, Things, the list goes on.  However, I‚Äôm leaning towards Remember the Milk, and am testing a combination of using Fluid.app to run RTM on the desktop, and the iPhone app.  I‚Äôm not sold yet.  One iPhone app I found is &lt;a href=&quot;http://buckaroosoftware.com/CheckOff.html&quot;&gt;CheckOff&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively simple list app.  What is nice about it is something I‚Äôve not really seen in another list type app.  You can create templates for often repeated tasks.  So each time you want the list, you do not have to recreate it.  I‚Äôd actually love to have a desktop app that does the same thing.  I‚Äôm still searching for the set of tools that fit like that favorite pair of jeans, and would sincerely love for any and all suggestions.  I‚Äôd even entertain scrapping my use of Thunderbird and Lightning if the shoe fit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Even Call it Second Day Air AT&amp;T?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/mrfrosted/240308153/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/ups_scooter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ups scooter&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So with AT&amp;amp;T offering $99 refurbished iPhones until the thirty-first, I swallowed my bitterness towards cell phone contracts and ordered a phone Saturday morning.  Like 8am on Saturday.  They offered free 2nd Day Air, but stupid me didn‚Äôt check the method, I just assumed it would be regular US mail.  I received an email Sunday saying the item had been shipped, which led me to believe even more so that it had shipped Saturday via US mail.  However, yesterday morning, I took a closer look at the email, and saw tracking info.  It was being shipped UPS, and the tracking info showed no movement.  Today I checked it, and it left Dallas at 8:15pm.  So much for 2nd day air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from now being anxious to start &lt;s&gt;playing with&lt;/s&gt; using my iPhone, (I‚Äôll be in a location that doesn‚Äôt have any internet to speak of through the weekend), I‚Äôll be leaving for said trip first thing tomorrow morning, so I didn‚Äôt want the phone sitting on my porch until Sunday evening.  I called UPS thinking that I could simply have them keep the package at the Tampa shipping center, and pick it up before I left.  Even if I didn‚Äôt have time to activate it, it wouldn‚Äôt be sitting there beckoning some noisy teenager to steal it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPS‚Äôs automated 1-800 number leaves something to be desired to say the least.  They must have held a competition for the most annoying voice, because this woman‚Äôs voice is disturbing to say the least.  I tried the usual ‚Äúoperator‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù at the prompts, but each time was met with the recording asking me if I wanted to ‚Äútrackapackage‚Äù.  Yes, a new word in the English lexicon, ‚Äútrackapackage‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally found a human via a local UPS Store, who told me the magic word is ‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù, and to just keep repeating it, ignoring anything the automated prompts tried to use to derail me from talking to a human.  This worked, and after a few minutes on hold, I was speaking to a real live person.  This woman, Danielle I believe she told me her name was, said that UPS doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúintercept‚Äù packages before their first attempted delivery.  I grumbled a ‚Äúthanks AT&amp;amp;T and UPS‚Äù, and she said to give her the tracking number, and &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; the package were to arrive in Tampa before 6pm, someone &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to pull it and I could pick it up this evening.  However when she saw the timestamp on the origin scan from Dallas, she didn‚Äôt sound hopeful that scenario would unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I must find a neighbor who can check on the package and hold it for me, which really isn‚Äôt a big deal, but had I known that 2nd day Air didn‚Äôt really mean 2nd Day air, I would have paid the extra charge to have it overnighted, and avoided the headache altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately my Nokia has a pretty good 3G connection, and a decent browser, not to mention Google mail/maps, so I won‚Äôt be totally disconnected, not that I couldn‚Äôt probably stand going dark for a few days, but I‚Äôve got too much work pending to completely go off the grid.  Plus, I‚Äôm really looking forward to snapping some shots of the last sunset of ‚Äò08 and first sunrise of ‚Äò09 for a New Years day post.  The pass on the north end of the island I‚Äôll be on has a great vantage point for taking both, and now that I‚Äôm a little more familiar with the little point and shoot camera I‚Äôve got, not to mention sporting a tripod now, I‚Äôm really hoping to get some good photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cleaning My Online House</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/signal_focus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;signal focus&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;I‚Äôve started a draft of a post on getting older, New Year‚Äôs resolutions, and where I want to be in ‚Äò09, but an aside to that is I‚Äôve come to the realization that I need to limit the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù of my online world, which is the predominate one I live in.  Specifically, the last couple of days that means cleaning out syndication feeds, and not just pruning dead ones.  It means seriously evaluating everything that comes through my reader and determining if it‚Äôs a source of information or entertainment that is of value to me; determining if the volume of content justifies a constant bombardment from the source.  Because several items in my reader are of time sensitive nature, I generally have my reader always open, fetching content every 15 minutes.  Only when I‚Äôm in a serious crunch mode do I shut the reader down.  I‚Äôm sure I could create filters of some nature that only fetched the time sensitive ones at a more regular interval, and the less time sensitive set to a manual updating, however I‚Äôve come to enjoy the steady flow of information throughout the day.  It‚Äôs just that I need to hone that stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that‚Äôs also become abundantly clear over the last few weeks is that several of the sources in my feed reader are being duplicated due to my use of Twitter (either automated heralds of new blog posts, or manual linking).   Seeing that Twitter contains entertaining and informative tidbits that don‚Äôt make it onto most blogs, the obvious choice was to dump the source in my reader, and continue to follow via Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, the genesis of this revelation was the result of having &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.37signals.com/svn/&quot;&gt;signal vs. noise&lt;/a&gt;,  and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://productblog.37signals.com/&quot;&gt;37 signals product blog&lt;/a&gt; in my reader, and following &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jasonfried&quot;&gt;@jasonfried&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.  There is so much redundancy and overlapping between the 3, that more often than not, all 3 would hit my ‚Äúinbox‚Äù within minutes of each other with the same content.  I certainly understand why, as most people aren‚Äôt following all 3, so Jason and 37 signals are trying to market and share information to the widest audience.  Unfortunately for those like me, it becomes a nuisances, albeit an enlightening one that spurred a much needed tuning of the throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I‚Äôm in this mode, it also means that I‚Äôm shrewdly evaluating all blog feeds.  A perfect example was tonight, Dave Winer‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;.  5 photos, in separate posts, with no context.  Rather I should say, no context &lt;em&gt;to me&lt;/em&gt;.  Though I generally find his posts about blogging and ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù thought provoking, whether I agree with his point or not, the majority of his content isn‚Äôt germane to my goals and focus.  So out it went.  That‚Äôs not to say when I have some downtime, and want to read a movie review from an amateur film buff ( and I use amateur only in the sense that reviewing films doesn‚Äôt put food on his table, as far as I know), that I won‚Äôt wander over to the actual site and peruse his site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly this process is also being applied to whom I follow on Twitter, as evident by this &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/miklb/status/1070037601&quot;&gt;declaration:&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;when someone incessantly twitters about twitter, I call the line and unfollow.&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;  This also applies to a few of the more recent people I‚Äôve followed who find it necessary to welcome each of their new followers with a new tweet.  Is there any harm in using all 140 characters and possibly welcoming more than one at a time?  And is it really necessary to welcome them?  Why not just provide good and interesting content in your tweets instead?  Even better, if they reply to something you talk about, bloody respond to them.  That‚Äôs the purpose.  It‚Äôs not all about you‚Ä¶anyway, I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I feel as though I should clarify that I‚Äôve resurrected this weblog as a means to commit thoughts down to ‚Äúpaper‚Äù, and affirm to myself why I‚Äôve chosen this path, the one of an online world.  If for some reason it provokes someone else, all the better.  If it provokes a discussion, then I‚Äôve succeeded.  If at worst, I can look back and provoke myself to get back on track, it‚Äôs not all that bad a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Twitter is Just‚Ä¶Cool</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I‚Äôve oft meant to write something about Twitter, specifically since I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeldman.com/2008/01/03/self-publishing-is-the-new-blogging/&quot;&gt;Zeldman‚Äôs ‚ÄúSelf Publishing is the New Blogging‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And ch-ching was heard in the land. And the (not citizen) journalists heard it, and it got them pecking into their Blackberries and laptops.

And then the writers and designers, ashamed at rubbing shoulders with common humanity, discovered the 140-character Tweet and the Tumblr post. No stink of commerce, no business model, nothing that could even charitably be called content, and best of all, no effort. Peck, peck, send. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered ‚Äúblogging‚Äù and the culture surrounding it just before what I assume is the time when ‚Äú‚Ä¶(not citizen) journalists heard it‚Ä¶‚Äù.  It was an exciting discovery, which ultimately lead me to the career I (usually) enjoy now.  And as much I probably contribute to the &lt;em&gt;not citizen&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äúpecking at their Blackberries and laptops‚Äù, and as much as Twitter has long lost the purity of ‚Äúnot having a stink of commerce‚Äù, I personally enjoy the freedom of 140 character rants, without any concern whether anyone is reading them or not.  I use Twitter solely because there‚Äôs a certain cathartic release in firing off something like ‚Äútrying to explain browser differences on form styling is like swimming in 3 day old mashed potatoes‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that wasn‚Äôt the original intent of this post.  Rather, there really is another reason I enjoy Twitter.  It‚Äôs a compelling way to get a glimpse into the lives of people that you‚Äôve crossed paths with and whom you find interesting or share common interests with, but haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to really get to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then something like today happens.  I‚Äôd been away from technology the last twenty four hours, and wanted a light hearted way of catching up with what was going on in the world, and the web in particular.  Plus, there‚Äôs always a few good laughs along the way (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies&quot;&gt;@hotdogsladies&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/cscott_twitter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;twitter&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;Then this tweet came across Twitterific.  First, I‚Äôve not really ever met either Chris or Sean.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamzed.com/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; I began following after he began following me at blogOrlando3.  I wasn‚Äôt even sure who he was until the brief encounter we had at the after party.  (Chris was the lucky guy handing out the drink tickets.  Everyone‚Äôs best friend for at least 5 minutes.)  Afterward I realized that he helped &lt;a href=&quot;http://hyku.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Josh Hallet&lt;/a&gt; with the the conference.  I, like many people, truly enjoyed blogOrlando, the vibe surrounding it, and felt anyone who put that together or were involved I‚Äôd like to eventually get to know.  So I follow several people that were at blogOrlando, including Chris, Josh, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jharr&quot;&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seancoates.com/&quot;&gt;Sean&lt;/a&gt; I first encountered in the Habari IRC channel when he came along looking for help with getting some patches committed so he could fix the s9y importer and migrate his blog to Habari.  Always excited for a new user/community member, I committed his patches, and soon noticed him hanging around the channel.  Long story short, Sean is now part of the PMC of Habari, and can commit his own damn patches  now ;-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point?  I guess after writing this I don‚Äôt have something profound to say.  I‚Äôd just never seen a correspondence between Chris or Sean on Twitter in the time I‚Äôve been following both.  Certainly I don‚Äôt know either well enough to know if they actually have met, which wouldn‚Äôt be out of the realm of possibility for two developers (who also share a love of great beer, another reason I enjoy their tweets) to have met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it gave me one of those smiles and six degrees of separation moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, did I mention it gave me a smile after a couple of shit weeks?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Favorite Album of 2008: The Gaslight Anthem's The '59 Sound</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/59sound_web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The '59 Sound&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;First, let me reiterate, it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; favorite album of 2008, not a declaration that‚Äôs the &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt; album of the year.  From the opening crackles of the old skool sound of a needle on vinyl on &lt;cite&gt;Great Expectations&lt;/cite&gt; to the melancholy anthem-esque &lt;cite&gt;The Backseat&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;The ‚Äò59 Sound&lt;/cite&gt; is just a great listen all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album is ripe with all the things I turn to in the music I listen to regularly‚Äîwhiskey and cigarette tinged vocals, driving bass lines, and jangly guitar riffs.  The subject of the lyrics tend to revolve around mortality, regret, and lost loves, without ever sounding like there‚Äôs no chance for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But every slow mans song
Is a night I'd like to spend with you
Just twisting the night away
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;cite&gt;Cassanova, Baby!&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics of the Jersey based band have sighted the obvious Springsteen influences (think &lt;cite&gt;Nebraska&lt;/cite&gt; era Springsteen, not &lt;cite&gt;Born in the U.S.A&lt;/cite&gt;), which to me isn‚Äôt a bad thing.  However, they also have a punk tinged sensibility ala another band that‚Äôs still in heavy rotation in my music players, Lucero.  I lament having missed The Gaslight Anthem this fall when they passed through town, however, they are playing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.langerado.com/2009/langerad09.php?sec=14&quot;&gt;Langerado Festival&lt;/a&gt; this year, which has a line up that reads like my 5 star ratings in iTunes.  Ryan Adams, Lucero, The Gaslight Anthem, The Pogues, Bad Brains, the list goes on.  I certainly hope to catch them in  a club on their way to or from the festival, as that‚Äôs really the environment I think they‚Äôd be best.  Packed, sweaty, and bourbon fueled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/iUsoQw9l1DA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/iUsoQw9l1DA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/embed&amp;gt;&lt;/object&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other albums were on my list of faves for ‚Äò08.  Second place most certainly would go to The Hold Steady‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;Stay Positive&lt;/cite&gt; if for nothing other than the last track, &lt;cite&gt;Slapped Actress&lt;/cite&gt;.  However, the whole album simply rocks.  Also on the short list would be the Brian Eno/David Byrne collaboration &lt;cite&gt;Listen Everything That Happens Will Happen Today&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights for 2008 were Cat Power‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;Jukebox&lt;/cite&gt;, Drive by Trucker‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;Brighter Than Creation‚Äôs Dark&lt;/cite&gt;,  Okkervil River‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;Stand In&lt;/cite&gt;, Vampire Weekend‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;Vampire Weekend&lt;/cite&gt;, and Deerhunter‚Äôs &lt;cite&gt;Microcastle&lt;/cite&gt;, though that last one was only recently released, and I‚Äôve not listened to it a lot yet, but my initial thoughts are it‚Äôs a nice change of pace from my regular listening styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any indie albums at the top of your list for 2008 I should check out?  I‚Äôm always looking to discover new music (especially indie bands I can get from emusic).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Calendar Syncing: Lightning, Google, iCal and Nokia e62</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/files/sync.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sync&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;I‚Äôm still railing against signing a contract with a cell carrier, so I haven‚Äôt purchased a new phone in some time, but the bigger need to have a more robust cell phone these days had me revive my Nokia e62.  All in all, it‚Äôs a pretty good phone, with a decent built in browser (based on Webkit if I recall) and works well with my existing pay as I go plan.  I even managed to coax an unlimited data plan out of AT&amp;amp;T.  The e62 also plays pretty well with my Macs‚Äîbluetooth syncing of contacts and calendar, the Nokia Media manager will sync an iTunes folder directly to the phone, so a 2GB card gives me a decent amount of music for on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I recently began using Thunderbird 3.0, aka Shredder, which is still pre beta.  That meant to really use it, I had to use the nightly build of Lightning, 1.0pre.  As with any Mozilla alpha product, you can expect most extensions to not work, which certainly is the case with these two.  I really like the combination, despite the occasional glitches, and wanted to find a way to sync Lightning with the phone.  What an adventure that turned out to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything I found searching the web suggested using an extension for syncing the Google Calendar with Lightning, which obviously wasn‚Äôt compatible with these versions, and even testing it with the stable releases, I couldn‚Äôt get it to work, so off I searched for another way.  Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;GCALDaemon&lt;/a&gt;, something I‚Äôd seen written about on several ocassions but had never quite investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/usage12.html&quot;&gt;Mac OS X installation&lt;/a&gt; guidelines (installing in Applications vs usr/local/sbin), and being sure to use the the shell script config-editor definitely is the simplest way.  I‚Äôm certainly not a black belt in unix-fu, but following the instructions for &lt;a href=&quot;http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/usage.html#top&quot;&gt;syncing with Sunbird/Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and the config-editor even I was able to get Lighting 1.0pre synced with a Google Apps calendar fairly effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to sync iCal (or so I thought) with the Google Calendar so I could then sync it with my phone.  I briefly toyed with GCALDaemon for that too, however my impatience led me to give Google‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/calaboration/&quot;&gt;Calaboration&lt;/a&gt; tool a spin. Fortunately it was quick and painless, and I was soon syncing the same Google Apps calendar with iCal that was synced with Lightning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However (&lt;em&gt;there‚Äôs always a but, isn‚Äôt there&lt;/em&gt;), I soon found out that you can‚Äôt sync from the phone‚Äôs calendar to a network calendar.  So anything I were to add to the phone, would need to be transferred to the network calendar.  I‚Äôm pretty lazy as it is, so adding a step like that seemed like a recipe for losing an important date.  For iPhone users, this also seems to be the case.  So now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another search turned up &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenokiablog.com/2008/09/29/how-to-sync-google-calendar-apple-ical-and-nokia-phone-calendar/&quot;&gt;this post on syncing a Nokia calendar with iCal and Google&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goosync.com/&quot;&gt;Goosnyc&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn‚Äôt keen on using a 3rd party service, but I figured I‚Äôd test it out at least, and see where it goes.  Their SMS to automate the sync settings never arrived, so I followed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goosync-forum.com/showthread.php?t=8&quot;&gt;Nokia e61/e62 manual syncing&lt;/a&gt; instructions, which were spot on (once I figured out that I needed to look in ‚ÄúOffice‚Äù for the Sync settings), and within a few minutes, my Nokia e62 was synced to my Google Apps calendar which was synced to LIghtning and iCal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to sort out a few minor issues with the phone now syncing with iCal, as I had some holiday calendars and what not synced to the phone, which then added the dates to the Google Calendar, so in iCal I was getting the same holidays showing up multiple times.  That‚Äôs easily remedied by not displaying those calendars, but conveniently gives me all of the holidays on the other calendars.  I also need to make sure that when I sync the phone to iCal, I don‚Äôt get duplicate entries in the local calendar, but again, I think I can get around that by simply creating a ‚Äúphone‚Äù calendar, and hiding it in iCal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goosync does require a manual sync to Google Calendar, but that‚Äôs less of a hassle than migrating entries from one calendar to the other.  All in all, I‚Äôm quite pleased now that I can add items directly from an email into my calendar, or right into my phone, and it will conveniently appear in all of my calendars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone knows of a more seemless method, I‚Äôm all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Twitter Productivity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter Productivity.  Sounds like an oxymoron doesn‚Äôt it?  Well, with the recent announcement of &lt;a href=&quot;http://getsatisfaction.com/iwantsandy/topics/a_fork_in_the_road_an_important_announcement_about_i_want_sandy&quot;&gt;i want sandy‚Äôs demise&lt;/a&gt;, I came across a Twitter bot that actually seems like a productive tool for the Twitterer.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/timer&quot;&gt;Timer&lt;/a&gt; allows you to simply follow it, in which it then follows you.  Then you simply send Timer a direct message to remind you of something upcoming, ie, d Timer 60 call client X.  You‚Äôll then get a direct message 60 minutes later reminding you to call client X.  Seems it only recognizes minutes, so I‚Äôm not sure how efficient it is for reminding you of something past the short term, but it‚Äôs still an interesting tool.  Couple the concept with the fact that the developers of i want sandy are now working for Twitter, we might see similar type tools integrated into Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Consolidating, Focusing, and Rookie Mistakes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As my online endeavors grow, I find myself with different sites floating around, doing nothing, as I have so many ideas for each site, I wind up not posting to any of them.  I originally started Blogging Meta because I thought I wanted to have a personal site, and a site that I could focus on tech related blogging.  Well, as I‚Äôve said, neither came to fruition, and I‚Äôve found myself lately feeling as if I had some dual personality that were just spinning their wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So tonight I decided to merge the two sites, and really try to gain some focus.  I still have my cooking site, which I still intend to further focus on, but hopefully by committing to using this site again for everything not cooking related, I just might be able to accomplish both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rookie mistakes came from the fact that since Habari doesn‚Äôt have an importer in place yet to import one Habari install into another, I was faced with the only option of deleting the existing database, which was basically an import from the original WordPress installation, then dumping the bloggingmeta database, doing a quick search and replace for urls, importing that file directly into the database, then re-importing the old wordpress database using the importer plugin.  What I failed to do was check what was active in the plugins.  I already had the twitter plugin installed, so I‚Äôm guessing that it kept the settings from the old site, thus upon import, all the new posts were twittered.  Complete‚Ä¶rookie‚Ä¶mistake.  Couple with that that I also left the pingback plugin active, it tried to ping all the posts while importing.  Another party foul.  So not only did I spam Twitter, my import royally failed, so I was faced with doing the whole process over again, albeit this time I deactivated the offending plugins, and the import went off mostly without a hitch.  I might have lost a few old posts and/or comments, but all in all, I‚Äôm pleased with the outcome considering I‚Äôm doing this at 2 a.m. in the morning, and my focus might not be what it should be.  I wish I could write it off as having had a few adult beverages, but alas, I would be lying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days I will be doing some tweaking here and there, and shutting down the other site (and doing a 301 redirect).  I really like the typography of Ali‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.awhitebox.com/dark-autumn-a-new-habari-theme&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt;, so I most likely will try to find the custom image I had made for the bottom, and trick out a few plugins.  At least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Roku Netflix Player First Impressions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/roku_netflix.jpg&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;Netflix Player&quot; /&gt;I had read a few things about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roku.com/netflixplayer/&quot;&gt;Roku Netflix Player&lt;/a&gt;, but hadn‚Äôt given it much thought.  Then, while watching the 3 DVD‚Äôs we had sitting around from Netflix for over 2 weeks collect dust, I began to think more about the player.  The 3 DVD at a time subscription is $16.99 a month, and as I said, we really don‚Äôt watch that many movies (I‚Äôm more a a TV junkie really), so it really hasn‚Äôt been a very good deal for us.  The Roku player is $100+ shipping and handling (more about that in a bit), and requires the $8.99 a month subscription or greater, which allows one DVD at a time, plus unlimited streaming movies.  So my thinking was, I would almost pay for the player in the first year downgrading to the lower subscription, it‚Äôs a no-brainer.  Plus, there‚Äôs a 30 day money back guarantee, so worst case scenario, I get it, it sucks, I send it back, and simply rethink the subscription plan regardless.  So a quick discussion with the lady of the house, and we decided to order it and give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was last Thursday.  We were given an option of spending an extra $10 on 2-day Fedex (on top of the $10 ground), so be the anxious geek, I pony up the extra money, thinking I‚Äôd have it on Monday.  Well, Roku sent an email saying the player would be shipped from the warehouse in the next 7-10 days on Friday, which rubbed me the wrong way, as that wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the order process, but OK.  Nothing else to my knowledge was emailed out (we used her email address).  So I was resolved to not see it for 2 weeks.  However, when I returned from running errands today, there it was sitting on my porch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since ordering, I had done a bit more research, and the one downfall I have seen repeated over and over is the limited amount of content available, as Netflix has to obtain digital rights to the content before being able to offer it.  Consensus seemed to say that it is mostly older TV series, indie/foreign films, and few older major releases tossed in here and there.  I wasn‚Äôt too anxious to really look at the selection, as I wasn‚Äôt expecting to receive it for another week at least, but I‚Äôm more an indie/foreign film kinda fan than Spiderman 3 anyway, so as I said, I‚Äôve got 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As other reviews mention, it‚Äôs nothing but a simple little black box, with an external power supply.  A small, boxy remote and RCA cables fill out the included items.  Again, as I wasn‚Äôt expecting it so soon now, I hadn‚Äôt obtained additional cables (like optical audio to connect to the receiver or component video, which are all supported, as well as HDMI and  s-video).  I admit right up front I‚Äôm not the techno-geek when it comes to these aspects, so I‚Äôm not really qualified to say one thing or the other about the supported connections, etc.  The player can connect via wireless or ethernet (however, as I understand it, it doesn‚Äôt support 802.11n).  I gave the wireless a shot first, but figured I might have to run an ethernet cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up was really easy, a simple onscreen walk through entering my WEP key, a quick connection to Netflix, update some (firmware??) and restart, it gives a code that you then enter into your Netflix account.  Maybe 5 minutes total, and my account was connected to the TV, any movies in my queue that were available for the Instant Viewing was added to that queue as well, and I could see them on the screen.  I poked around quickly on the site, looking for something to add.  Dexter season 1 was there, I never saw the first season, and figured it would be a good test.  I added it to my queue, and within 30 seconds or so, it showed up on the TV.  TV seasons only need the season added, all episodes are available, whereas with DVD‚Äôs you have to add each disc.  I navigated to episode one, clicked play, a few seconds later it starts downloading, I see &lt;strong&gt;‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ quality&lt;/strong&gt; after it loads (still not sure what that means, but I think it has something to do with my connection.  I generally get 18Mb/s or better with my wireless connection, even faster wired).  All told, roughly a minute before the show started playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Episode played fine, no skipping, no jumping, quality was as good as my FIOS cable (even with the included RCA cables).  Fast forwarding is a bit different, as they break shows up into little chapters of sorts, with stills for each section.  I haven‚Äôt really paid close enough attention yet to see what the time frame of each are, but they seem like 1 minute or so apiece. Different, but easy enough to adapt to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the TV junky that I am, I poked around a bit more, and found that a lot of Law and Order SVU/CI seasons were available.  I often find myself watching reruns on TNT and USA Network, as I never really watched the show during it‚Äôs first runs, and heck, why not just watch it in order without the annoying commercials on those networks?  I added SVU season one, and watched the first two episodes.  Again, quality was fine (once I switched the perspective back to 4:3 from 16:9), with no skipping/jumping.  One criticism I‚Äôve read about the player is that there‚Äôs no hard drive and no real buffering.  ( A interview with a Roku exec I read said they did some research, and found people didn‚Äôt want to hear a fan/HD spinning, thus one  reason it doesn‚Äôt have one.  Plus, they wanted to hit a price point, as well as eliminate as many parts that could fail.  Regardless of the reasons, so far, I don‚Äôt see a need for any of that with the connection speed I have.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;
All in all, first day in, it seems like a fine investment.  I found several more movies quickly browsing through the instant available selections (this has to be done on the computer, you can‚Äôt search for movies from the TV), so not counting the TV shows, I have 7 films queued up.  Plus the 3 DVD‚Äôs collecting dust, so I think I‚Äôll be fine for the short term, they seem to be actively adding more content, and I‚Äôm sure as the player(s) gain popularity, they will be in a better bargaining position to obtain more.  If your goal is to watch a lot of new releases,  don‚Äôt plan on dropping your regular subscription down anytime soon.  However,  at $100, the player seems like a fair investment if you are a TV/movie junkie.  Also, there seems to be quite a bit of children‚Äôs content as well as History channel type documentaries, so the cost might be enticing to parents as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll discover more as I use it, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask questions if you are interested in the player.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Obligatory Response to New iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really looking forward to today‚Äôs confirmation of the lower price 3G iPhone.  I purposely held off (for a change) on adopting a 1st gen Apple product, knowing the 3G service would be coming.  However, now that reports have confirmed that you will &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to sign a contract, I‚Äôm not so sure now that I will be adopting the new phone.  I genuinely do not use a cell phone for talking enough to justify signing such a contract, and being required to have such a plan (what $70 a month?).  The previous $20 a month data plan plus minimal talk time per minute was fine with me, as I have used it with other ‚Äúsmartphones‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be curious to see how they treat 1st gen iPhone users who currently are doing pay as you go plus data plans.  Perhaps those will still be allowed to use the prepay, and I‚Äôll pick one up on teh cheap, until I can justify signing a contract paying for that much phone usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other option is to wait to see what happens to iPod Touch prices, as I may get just as much use out of one of those as an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a suggestion for a smartphone that can be used with pay as you go and unlimited data plan with AT&amp;amp;T, has a great web browser support, bluetooth, and is iSync capable, I‚Äôd love to hear about it. &lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt;:  and can be purchased new/used for $200 or less without a contract.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Words of Wisdom</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Without getting into the whys and hows this statement came about, I find it very simple, yet poignant and applicable to many of life‚Äôs situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We're still learning to walk, and we're going to trip every now and then and sometimes when we run, we're going to fall on our faces. But as long as we get up, try again, and learn something from the experience, in the end, skinned knees and all, it'll be worth it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morydd.net/&quot;&gt;Sean.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; - might I add, I‚Äôm in a new-ish romantic relationship, which &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; recently hit a bump, and perhaps this analogy hit home there more than anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mac SVN Monitoring Widget</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lab.arc90.com/2008/04/svn_notifier.php&quot;&gt;SVN Notifiier&lt;/a&gt; is a handy little Mac Dashboard widget that, using Growl, will notify you when a local working copy is out of date.  I‚Äôve not quite gotten the ‚Äústicky‚Äù notice to work, but I just might need to edit the actual Growl settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it‚Äôs nice to be able at a glance check your dashboard, or see a little growl notice pop up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leaving the Nest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week it was proposed and not shot down in flames that my first foray into a Habari theme, &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/mzingi&quot;&gt;mzingi&lt;/a&gt; , intended as a simple, image free theme to be used as a foundation for building proper themes, should be included into the core download of &lt;a href=&quot;http://habariproject.org&quot;&gt;Habari&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was humbled and honored to say the least, and so from here on out, all development for this project will be maintained by the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all who‚Äôve helped, and shared their appreciation for it‚Äôs intended purpose, and I trust the community will continue to use it for creating full fledged themes.  Feels a little odd, but satisfying at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quick Update on Themes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/updated-themes&quot;&gt;updated my themes&lt;/a&gt;, and since that time a change has been made in trunk in how pagination is handled.  All 3 three themes have been updated for this change.  I will be leaving download links for the previous versions up as well, as I &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; those versions should work with 0.4.1.  If you experience any problems with either version, please set me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downloads and more info on each theme available on their original post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/swanky-theme&quot;&gt;swanky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/mzingi&quot;&gt;mzingi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/harvest-field-a-new-habari-theme&quot;&gt;Harvest Field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.miklb.com&quot;&gt;demo site&lt;/a&gt; up and running to check them out.  I still need to tweak the themeswitcher plugin so you can only select certain themes from your theme directories, so note that only &lt;strong&gt;my 3 themes&lt;/strong&gt; have the switcher code.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apple Drivers in VMware Fusion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think with the help of a google search and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gruby.com/2007/12/14/bluetooth-in-vmware-fusion/&quot;&gt;Scott Gruby&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôve figured out how to use my bluetooth keyboard in VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Finally, I found a reference to inserting the Leopard DVD while in Windows. I tried this and when I did, the BootCamp driver installer came up and installed my drivers. Perfect; why couldn‚Äôt VMWare say something about this on their website?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Scott and I agree, why isn‚Äôt this documented somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 8/1/08&lt;/em&gt;Seems you also have to disconnect the USB Bluetooth Host Controller to get it to work.  Something about only one OS can control the device at a time, so the machine gets confused when the two are both connected.  Disconnecting the controller, shutting down the XP install, then restarting VMware Fusion finally got it working.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Updated Themes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been quite lazy (or busy, you decide) lately, and have been meaning to update the 3 themes I‚Äôve released to work with the latest trunk.  Previously, I kept decent todos and a svn repo for mzingi, but this time I simply bore down in some late night frenzy and got everything up-to-date.  I‚Äôve got a new svn repo to work with, and will check them in at some point in the next few days, and hopefully will be able to better outline any changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the changes to mzingi were minor, just a few code changes for things like atom links, and updating the YUI fonts and style sheet.  I also added some styling for draft posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as swanky and Harvest Field, they have more extensive changes, most evident in the sidebar content.  Harvest Field now only uses built in code for the footer content ‚Äì the about, recent comments and more posts links.  The sidebar in Harvest Field is entirely plugin reliant now, sans the search and subscribe link.  It supports by default the Twitter, linkoid (for aside like posts - which is also excluded from the more posts offset) and the very nifty blogroll plugin.  All three have their own templates in the theme.  I also added support for the credits due plugin, with a built in page template, and conditional code in the footer.  Also, I &lt;em&gt;borrowed&lt;/em&gt; the watermark for draft posts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/connections&quot;&gt;michaeltwofish‚Äôs connections theme&lt;/a&gt;, and a little more emphasis on comments in moderation styling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swanky was also updated to use the current Twitter plugin/template, as well as added support for the blogroll plugin.  If these plugins are not active, nothing will show, nothing will break.  Recommended plugins are listed on the themes page.  As with Harvest Field, the draft watermark and comments in moderation were addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, if you find a bug, or would like to see something added/need help, please leave a comment either on this post or the original post for the theme in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/swanky-theme&quot;&gt;swanky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/mzingi&quot;&gt;mzingi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/harvest-field-a-new-habari-theme&quot;&gt;Harvest Field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I‚Äôm putting the finishing touches on a demo site, which I‚Äôll be adding links to the aforementioned theme posts.  Just need to decide how I want to add the theme switcher code (I‚Äôm trying to decide between adding a new fixed element at the top of each theme, or simply adding the dropdown to each sidebar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, much thanks go to the community for the help and assistance in putting these together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt; Twitter, linkoid, blogroll, and credit due plugins can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habariproject.org/dist/plugins/&quot;&gt;Habari extras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; To clarify the ‚ÄúCredits‚Äù &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; is accomplished by 1)activating the creditsdue plugin from extras 2)create a page with the slug ‚Äúcredits‚Äù, you can add additional content to the page if you want 3) there is no three (I‚Äôve always wanted to say that!).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Migrating Servers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What an experience this has been.  I hope to write a comprehensive post at some point about the experience, but suffice to say, it‚Äôs been quite the crash course on Apache, Debian, and DNS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with some curiosity, in which I purchased a &lt;a href=&quot;http://slicehost.com&quot;&gt;Slice&lt;/a&gt;, and began poking around with the many tutorials they offer.¬† Ultimately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://asymptomatic.net/&quot;&gt;Owen&lt;/a&gt; provided me with his LAMPME script that did the basic setup for a debain, apache2, PHP 5, MySQL 5 set up, using mod_vhost (please don‚Äôt quote me on any of this :-D ), which sorta got me going.¬† I got a bit sidetracked, and confused with setting up phpMyAdmin (I‚Äôm not that comfortable with CLI yet), and let the whole thing just sit, unused for a month or so.¬† However, due to the persistent &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/gs-grid-service-intermittent-service-availability/&quot;&gt;problems with MediaTemple&lt;/a&gt; grid-servers, I vowed to stop shelling out money to them for the hassles.¬† If my sites go down, I want to be the one to blame, and no one else.¬† Besides, it‚Äôs high time that I learn more about this aspect of web development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, armed with help from&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skippy.net&quot;&gt;Skippy&lt;/a&gt;, and some new found confidence, I got everything set up so as to have a basic understanding of how/where things go, and started moving domains.¬† I‚Äôm just about done, with this being one of the last.¬† If anyone notices anything wonky, assuming I have visitors, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also which is quite cool so far, is that I‚Äôm going to deploy the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Multisite&quot;&gt;multi-site&lt;/a&gt; functionality of Habari to minimize the number of actual installs I have on the server, as I run everything off of head, this means less outdated installs.¬† Right now I‚Äôm looking at having just 2 actual installations, with everything else running off of those.¬† So far it‚Äôs worked out fine, though it took a little playing to get paths for things like images and files sorted out.¬† More on that later.¬† Certainly something that needs more attention, especially as silos mature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to everyone who‚Äôve helped in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Verizon Fios Experiences</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got off the phone with Verizon customer &lt;s&gt;migraine&lt;/s&gt; service, and am left completely mystified.  My story starts with the fact that Verizon didn‚Äôt notify us that their was a shortage of HD DVR boxes when we placed our order.  It continued to the installation process, where the affable technician, albeit sporting the classic plumber‚Äôs crack while installing, failed to explain to us that while he was connecting the DVR to the HD TV, that in fact, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to watch any HD programming.  I had to wait until the next business day to speak to anyone about the problem (installation was on a Saturday, and though they advertise 24/7 support, that doesn‚Äôt apply to most FIOS issues).  I was then explained to that there was a back order on the Motorola HD DVR boxes, and that it would probably be the end of the month (February) before they were in.  Sounded fair.  They would discount our account the price of the DVR until then, we‚Äôd get the new DVR via UPS, swap them out, mail back the standard box at no cost.  OK, slightly inconveniencing, but fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of March, I hadn‚Äôt heard anything, so I called customer service again.  I was given the same basic information, but this time, I was told middle of March.  Frustration is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid March, I call again, I‚Äôd really like to be watching some of the movies and programming I enjoy in HD.  This time, I was told it would be the end of the month, and that some boxes had already been swapped out, but there was still a back order.  Frustration is reaching the point of wanting to yell and reach through the phone and choke the people on the other end of the line, but I managed to remain calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to today.  I call to ask about this issue, as well as to inquire about picture-in-picture.  I get a tech support person who I‚Äôm sure isn‚Äôt based in the U.S., perhaps Mexico City?  Regardless, I inquire about the PIP.  This gentleman insists that if my TV supports PIP, then I should have PIP.  I explain to him that sure, with an antenna, I can watch PIP, but that PIP with the cable would require the box to split the signal, and when would this be introduced.  He doesn‚Äôt have a clue to what I‚Äôm talking about.  I ask to speak to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next gentleman I speak with is most likely Indian, again, the primary problem is communication, not nationality for me.  This person informs me that if I want PIP, I would need a second box, or use a splitter from the coax entering the house and would get PIP for the first 50 channels.  Again, I try to explain that for instance, BrightHouse supports PIP within their DVR boxes, but he doesn‚Äôt believe me.  After another tech question about using the ‚Äúlast‚Äù (previous) button.  The Verizon Fios boxes support 9999 channels, so if you want to watch, say channel 8, you can just enter 8, but there‚Äôs a delay, so I got into the habit of hitting 0008.  Well, to me it‚Äôs a bug, to them, I‚Äôm stupid, but if you type 0008, then 0084, the previous/last button won‚Äôt work.  If I do 8/84 it works.  What ever.  I then asked to be transferred to customer service, as tech support doesn‚Äôt know anything about FIOS DVR boxes.  Oh, and he comes back and says, ‚Äúthey are working on the PIP as we speak, and might be available in 6 months‚Äù, obviously someone was listening in and corrected him to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a very nice lady, most likely U.S. based.  She tells me she‚Äôs not been given any timeframes for the the swap out, and that she‚Äôs been collecting names to call back when she has information.  At this point, I‚Äôm completely frustrated, and want to just cancel the package, without penalty (technically, we signed a 2 year contract, with a $199 cancellation fee) because they are not providing all the services outlined in the contract.  I was transferred to a ‚Äúretention specialist‚Äù, again, most likely American, who said she didn‚Äôt know anything about PIP, nor did she have any time frames for when the boxes would be swapped.  I said I‚Äôd like to confirm I could cancel without penalty, and she said, no, you are still be provided with the bundled service.  I then outlined that I had been lied to about the time frame of replacement during the first month when I could have cancelled the service.  She simply ignored me.  Had I been told in mid February that it might 4 months before HD boxes would be available, I might not have signed on with Verizon at the time.  I could have gotten BrightHouse, without a contract, and simply switched when HD was available.  But no, Verizon felt is was better to lie and hide information and con us into keeping the contract for a short term gain, and the loss of long term satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say I have no qualms with the other two services provided, internet connection is as fast as advertised,  and the phone service is fine.  I don‚Äôt like the fact that to use the provided voice mail, I have to call a separate number to check my voice mail, I can‚Äôt simply call my own number to do so, but what ever, that‚Äôs what the memory is for on the phone I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd love to know just for personal satisfaction if indeed Verizon could be sued for their unscrupulous actions regarding the hiding/lying about HD service.  I highly doubt I would have much of a case, as I don‚Äôt have any real documentation as to who/when I spoke with about the time frames, which I generally tend to do, and will start doing again when speaking with customer service reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahh, now I feel better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Testing Diigo and Habari</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://h0bbel.p0ggel.org/habari-themes&quot;&gt;Habari Themes :: h0bbel.p0ggel.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://diigo.com&quot;&gt;Diigo&lt;/a&gt;, and am testing their post to blog feature built into their toolbar with Habari.  Figured h0bbel was a good link to use :-D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Did you know that currently there are thirteen publicly available themes ready for download and usage for your Habari install? Some of the themes that are available are ported from other blogging platforms, others are &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; Habari themes that doesn't originate anywhere else.

        <title>Swanky Theme</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated! See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/habari-theme-swanky-05beta-released&quot;&gt;latest post on details&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/swanky_screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;This week an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freecsstemplates.org/preview/swanky&quot;&gt;open source design &lt;/a&gt; came across my feed reader, and something about it caught my eye.  Immediately however, I didn‚Äôt think the header matched the design name, so I set about creating something a bit more  &lt;em&gt;‚Äúswanky‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;.  From there, I began porting it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://habariproject.org&quot;&gt;Habari&lt;/a&gt;.  The goal was a ready to go theme, with support for several of the popular available plugins.  To that end, Swanky supports half a dozen plugins, a couple of which are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For recommended plugins, Raman Ng‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.tinyau.net/archives/2007/07/02/habari-rn-related-posts-plugin/&quot;&gt; Related Posts plugin &lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.tinyau.net/archives/2007/08/30/habari-rn-tag-cloud-plugin&quot;&gt;Tag Cloud plugin&lt;/a&gt; will provide full intent and functionality of the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme also supports the Credit Due plugin that is available from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habariproject.org/dist/plugins/&quot;&gt;Habari Extras repository.&lt;/a&gt;  Activation of the plugin and the addition of a Credits page will automatically move the credits from the footer, and create a link to a page on your site at  example.com /credits, which will contain the original design credits which are asked to be kept in place, as well as credits for all plugins and the Habari theme itself. (It will also exclude the page /credits from the top navigation)  You do not need to add any content to the page, simply creating the page will suffice.  If you have any other ‚Äúshout outs‚Äù you‚Äôd like to add in addition to the plugins output, that will appear above the default output.  Without the plugin and page, the link for the original design and theme design will be shown in the footer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggested plugins include the aforementioned Credit Due, as well as the pingback plugin bundled with Habari, Gravatars (also in Habari Extras), and the Recent Comments plugin in Extras.  If the Recent Comments plugin is not installed, it will default to included code in the theme.  Using the Recent Comments plugin allows for user definition of some output, including adding a date, and how many recent comments to show. The default code simply displays 5 most recent, comment author and post.  The theme is coded to use the unordered list if you use the plugin, changing that would require editing the sidebar.php template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme also supports the Twitter plugin (also in the Extras Repo), and will show on pages that recent posts show.  (see below regarding dynamic display).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One small feature of the theme is that the middle sidebar is dynamic based on certain templates being viewed.  Single post views will not show the recent posts, rather the posts meta, as well as related posts (if that plugin is active).  If the Twitter plugin is active and configured, pages that show recent posts will also show above them your most recent tweet, twitter icon, and a link to your twitter page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is considered a .1alpha release, future versions, aside from bug fixing, will support more dynamic options for plugins to output content in the 2nd sidebar, among any other suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please direct any comments, bugs, suggestions to the comments on this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; I failed to mention, if you use the gravatar plugin, there is a default gravatar in the theme‚Äôs images directory that you can point to that matches the header (in the plugin options you can point to the image).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Habari .4 released</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://habariproject.org/en/0-4-released&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs official&lt;/a&gt;, Habari 0.4 DR has been released.  It‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;hopefully &lt;/em&gt;, the last developer release, and with .5 will enter beta status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/habari-0-3-released&quot;&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt; what it is about the community that gives me that &lt;em&gt;warm fuzzy&lt;/em&gt; feeling, and that continues to be the case as the project grows.  It‚Äôs especially enriching to see new community members contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who helped make this release possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a little more info about the new release, I‚Äôll let one of the newer community members, Michael Harris, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/2008/02/22/habari&quot;&gt;outline some of the big changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm very excited about where this project is going, and can only imagine where it will be a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FF3 beta alongside FF2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Came across this handy little ‚Äúapp‚Äù today.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dangerouslyawesome.com/2008/02/22/more-than-one-firefox-beta-to-rule-them-all-a-dave-martorana-concoction/&quot;&gt;MultiFirefox&lt;/a&gt; allows for multiple profiles to use different versions of the FireFox.  So you can keep your working copy of FireFox 2 and all your beloved extensions, and test/keep an eye on FireFox 3 beta.  So far, the &lt;em&gt;‚Äúold-school‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; del.icio.us extension is the one I‚Äôm really anxious to see work in 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs already a beta of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fireclipse.xucia.com/#Downloads&quot;&gt;Firebug&lt;/a&gt; that works in FF3, which satisfies a few of my itches.  I‚Äôd also like to see the web developer extension, but it seems the dev of that one won‚Äôt release a version until FF goes gold.  Scribefire seems to work, though I still haven‚Äôt gotten in the habit of using it.  Tiny URL extension is another one that I‚Äôve come to rely on, which isn‚Äôt FF 3 compatible at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AirPort Express and Verizon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Note to self: Verizon‚Äôs default WEP key on the Actiontec router is WEP 40 (which apparently is also WEP 64 :-/ ) in Leopard‚Äôs Airport Utility, not the default WEP 128 that the utility picks by default when trying to connect the APX to the existing wireless network to utilize AirTunes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TUAW Loses Credibility</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a Mac user.  I‚Äôm a Mac fan.  I‚Äôm not, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, a Mac fanboy.  I do however, read some Mac centric and Mac fanatic blogs.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuaw.com/&quot;&gt;TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt; is one.  I often scan the feed, as it tends to be subject matter I‚Äôm not interested in.  I‚Äôve &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/apple-weblog-or-iphone-weblog&quot;&gt;ranted before&lt;/a&gt; about some of the fanaticism and over the top coverage before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this evening, I was scanning some feeds, and the see the headline &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuaw.com/2008/02/13/putting-the-apple-store-geniuses-to-the-test&quot;&gt;Putting the Apple Store Geniuses to the Test&lt;/a&gt; and was immediately intrigued.  Several years ago, I worked in a retail Apple store.  It was quite enlightening in many, many ways, but for me, not really a good experience.  However, I did meet some very nice people, some very smart people, and learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, to call all employees of an Apple Store Geniuses, is ignorant, as the Geniuses, as pointed out in the comments of the post, are trained techs who do not do sales.  Of course, they can do sales for customers who come into the Genius Bar for issues, and wind up needing something, but it‚Äôs not their primary job description.  And as pointed out, Mac Specialists (the sales team) are generally knowledgeable in nich√© areas.  I worked with some extremely knowledgeable people who specialized in graphics, music, networking, you name it.  Everyone generally knew each persons strengths, and when they ran into a question they didn‚Äôt know, they knew who to ask, or as also pointed out, were savvy enough to Google search to help the customer.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs possible during the holidays that temporary seasonal employees might not be as versed or familiar with everyone, and a customer might not get the technical answers from such an employee.  But my experience was that those types of employees also were quick to explain their unfamiliarity with technical issues, and still sought out more experienced Specialists to assist the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that said, it‚Äôs very disappointing that the author of this post on TUAW didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about, and as the post title states, certainly gives me pause to the credibility of the site, and makes me wonder if there‚Äôs a certain &lt;em&gt;quota&lt;/em&gt; of posts they need to write, and was at a loss to find a relevant topic that he could bust out.  Which again, gives me pause to the site‚Äôs credibility of a reliable source of pertinent Apple related news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, one thing that I hadn‚Äôt seen mentioned in the comments, as everyone was coming to the defense of the Specialists, and pointing out that there was no commission based sales, is that isn‚Äôt entirely true.  This might have changed, but when I worked for an Apple Store, there were quarterly bonuses for full-time employees based on store sales goals.  Generally speaking however, the commenters are right, there isn‚Äôt any emphasis on over selling equipment.  Meaning, don‚Äôt push a Mac Book Pro on a family looking for a laptop for their kid heading to college who‚Äôll only be doing email, word processing, and web surfing, along with the obvious music stuff.  However, one of the biggest turn-offs that I dealt with, was the huge emphasis on pushing .Mac on all customers, even if you knew they didn‚Äôt need it, or understand it.  Certainly since then, .Mac has grown in it‚Äôs uses, and I can see how maybe it‚Äôs slightly more attractive for users, but then it was crap, and I felt &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt; pushing it on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this wasn‚Äôt meant to be a post slagging Apple retail, rather as a response to the post and comments in the aforementioned post.  Also note, this post was started late last night, and finished today without re-visiting the post to see if the author has amended or commented about his perspective, though my feed reader does pick up edited posts, and it hasn‚Äôt come through.  Ultimately though, there should be some level of responsibility and editing in a ‚Äúpro‚Äù blog such as that one, part of a bigger network of blogs whom make a pretty penny I‚Äôm sure in advertising.  Shame on you Blogsmith and TUAW for shoddy writing and editing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FireFox 3 beta</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing out b2 of FF 3 (Mac OS X Leopard), and it seems snappier, though none of my normal extensions are available for the beta, so that might be part of it.  Certainly can‚Äôt use it for everyday browsing because of that reason.  It seems kinda odd using the native OS X theme, with Safari like buttons instead of the standard FF HTML buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda like the Smart bookmarks feature, though the recent bookmarks isn‚Äôt really useful to me.  I‚Äôll be curious how that might be tied into del.icio.us bookmarks (however, seeing as Yahoo! is in turmoil, I will be exploring other bookmarking services, including checking on the status of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/&quot;&gt;scuttle&lt;/a&gt;, a GPL script for hosting your own bookmark library ala del.icio.us).  Any suggestions for similar services welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature I‚Äôm not keen on just yet is when I click on the favicon, normally that would highlight the entire URL in the address bar, now it gives me some odd identity information.  Definitely a PITA.  I really use that feature for copy and pasting URLs, though there might be an easier method for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll continue to run FF 3 on the laptop, and keep 2 on my main desktop, I understand a beta3 will be out Monday, and hopefully sooner than later a RC will be around, with most of the extensions being updated around that time.  I understand extension developers not trying to keep up with alpha and beta builds for official downloads, but at some point, they should be offering some kind of indication to users whether or not the extension will be available for the new version.  Nothing worse than upgrading only to find out your favorite extension isn‚Äôt being developed for the latest release.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://macthemes2.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16783761&quot;&gt;collection of iPhone-esque Growl themes.&lt;/a&gt;  I‚Äôve been a big fan of Growl for quite some time, and until now settled on the smoke theme.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, testing without a tag.  Again, ignore this, I‚Äôm too lazy to use a test install for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;now an edit - plugin updated to work without a tag being added&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Testing MarsEdit, take 3?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just trying out MarsEdit with Habari trunk.  Nothing to see here, move along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;edit: it seems that MarsEdit doesn‚Äôt like posts without a tag, or the metaweblog plugin doesn‚Äôt handle it.  Either way, once a tag is added, it‚Äôs fine.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;now trying to edit via MarsEdit.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

        <title>Mzingi 0.3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve made some small changes to &lt;a href=&quot;/mzingi&quot;&gt;the mzingi&lt;/a&gt; theme, most notably a few code changes to work with the most current revision. (1267 at time of writing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes fixing the atom feed link, addressing plugin hooks in the header and footer, and removing some extraneous code in the commentform that has been moved to the theme class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, some minor styling for the date has been added, as well as a screenshot and license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also added is the conditional code in the header to show the title on the home page as the blog title, or the post title followed by the blog title in single post pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things I‚Äôm looking to do in the next revision is to remove the Asides code, and add a template for the linkoid plugin, so if a user doesn‚Äôt want to use Asides, they don‚Äôt have to edit the theme, as well as leverage the ability of the plugin to allow the user to chose their own tags to be used in the feature and excluded from the primary content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also planned is author comment highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions are always warmly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the file from the &lt;a href=&quot;/mzingi&quot;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Textile for Habari</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm quite happy to see a new Habari user, Dylan, over at Trifold Design, has created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.trifolddesigns.com/textile-2-0-0-plugin-for-habari&quot;&gt;Textile plugin for Habari&lt;/a&gt;.  I too use many of the same tools Dylan does, and find myself using that markup more and more, even in email and on IRC (though, embarrassingly I didn‚Äôt realize it was actually Textile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven‚Äôt actually tested the plugin yet, though it did install fine, and it‚Äôs a .5 release, so I assume the author has vetted it himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, welcome to the community Dylan, it‚Äôs always great to see new people join in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that are looking for other markup plugins, you might look at Matt Read‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://drunkenmonkey.org/projects/habari-markdown&quot;&gt; Markdown&lt;/a&gt; plugin as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It's All Text and Leopard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had upgraded to Leopard, and one FireFox extension I‚Äôve come to count on was &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs All Text!&lt;/a&gt;.  Which allows you to chose a text editor of your choice to edit text fields.  Sometimes I need to do some code changes for sites in a text box, or work with a large amount of text, and it was quite handy to simply edit with TextMate.  It seemed to have broken in Leopard.  I checked the settings, and changing the path to &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;/usr/bin/mate&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; from &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;/usr/local/bin/mate&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; seemed to do the trick.  Might have just been me, but it‚Äôs working now, and I‚Äôm happy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Media Temple Follow Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I was just contacted by the customer support person from yesterday, and indeed there‚Äôs an Alex and I‚Äôve been credited in my account.  Thanks Alex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I immediately received a comment from an ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù who said he was with Media Temple on my previous post.   (He actually left two comments, as they went to moderation, and sent a contact message.)  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/give-the-gift-of-down-time#comment-88&quot;&gt;comment &lt;/a&gt; speaks for itself.  I did that, emailed him, giving the primary domain, and email address for my account.  Two days later, I get the automated emails about my credit card being declined.  Oh, right, I was mugged two weeks before Thanksgiving, and had my wallet stolen, so I had to get a new card.  But wait, weren‚Äôt they going to credit me?  I wait.  Another email.  I wait.  This time, an email with a name attached.   I respond, saying, Alex said he was going to be crediting my account.  Is there an Alex?  Was I duped?  No response at this point.  Meanwhile, I couldn‚Äôt FTP into my accounts most of yesterday because of some &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/authentication-issues-on-gs-gridcluster2/&quot;&gt;Authentication server  problems. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that I‚Äôm having the greatest success setting up the VPS server I‚Äôm testing from SliceHost.  Mostly MySQL problems.  I‚Äôm not ready to give up PHPMyAdmin just yet, nor FTP.  But that‚Äôs another post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Give the gift of down time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another six months, another disappointment in web hosting.  This time, the popular Media Temple grid-server.  For the past 2+ months, its been one problem after another, with the most recent being an 12 plus hour down time because of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/electrical-systems-maintenance-notice-nov-30th/&quot;&gt;failed maintenance&lt;/a&gt;.  They talk of credits for users, however I‚Äôm not seeing one in my account.  A company I work with received the email, however, not my personal account.  So on the heals of this debacle, they are offering &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/2007/12/04/give-the-gift-of-web-hosting/&quot;&gt;gift  cards&lt;/a&gt; for a years worth of hosting.  As if someone would want to give you a migraine for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice timing Media Temple‚Ä¶.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Redesign</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm working on a new theme, another open source design port.  Being the impatient person I am, I‚Äôve got a few tweaks still, so pardon any glitches while I finish up the tweaking.  Certainly interested in any comments, I‚Äôll post another more formal outline of the port when I‚Äôm done.  This will be available for download when it‚Äôs done.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>mzingi .2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A bit later than I thought it would be, but I‚Äôve updated &lt;a href=&quot;/mzingi&quot;&gt;Mzingi&lt;/a&gt; to reflect quite a few changes in Habari‚Äôs code.  Among the changes and additions for .2 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added header and footer hooks for plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added post status class, to allow for styling drafts differently than published posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added a 404 template, including a search box on that page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;updated the pagination code and styling on home.php and other multiple entry pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added the pingback filtering on comments.  Though a plugin, I'm assuming most people will use this feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added recent posts to sidebar.  This code will reflect which page you are on, and show the next five.  Meaning, if you are on page/2, it will show you the posts of page/3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added comment moderation code.  Visitors who's comments go into moderation will see their comment marked in moderation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to make these changes on this design (though I plan on a complete overhaul before the end of the year, so it might wait).  That said, I‚Äôm looking forward to feedback, and possibly seeing this go into the default download as another optional theme as has been suggested to me.  I‚Äôll leave that to others to decide, but I‚Äôm certainly not against the idea one bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please visit the &lt;a href=&quot;/mzingi&quot;&gt;Mzingi home page&lt;/a&gt; for the download link.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connections Theme for Habari</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/2007/11/17/habari-theme-connections-01alpha-released/&quot;&gt;Michael Harris&lt;/a&gt; has released a port of the popular WordPress theme, Connections, for Habari.  It‚Äôs good to see another port out there, obviously themes and plugins are what new user/adopters are going to be looking for.  I‚Äôll be updtating Mzingi and Harvest Field over the weekend, and hopefully work on another design port for this site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Managing Projects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/projpier_ss.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Much has been written the last few years about project management, &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/tag/GTD&quot;&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt; (getting things done) and productivity on the web, I personally subscribe to probably a dozen feeds that are specifically geared towards the subject, and have tried probably every conceivable idea, all to little success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my paying work, I work with a company that exclusively uses Basecamp, and have come to be quite familiar with the system, but can‚Äôt rationalize paying for the service for my own needs.  I do have a backpack account, but never quite have gotten a system in place there to do basic project management.  Now that I have 2 themes released for Habari, and several other small projects I‚Äôm working on, mulling over, I went looking last night for something that resembles Basecamp, but was under my own control, and if I ever wanted to collaborate with someone, could easily add them in.  I then remembered, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.activecollab.com/&quot;&gt;Active Collab&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;s&gt;open-source&lt;/s&gt; clone of Basecamp. (Active Collab is now closed source, and a commercial product.  Their old, .7.1 release is still available for download.  If you want an interesting read about how open source goes bad, read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.activecollab.com/old-posts/pricing-details-updated/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and comments regarding the new structure.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing it was now commercial, and priced completely towards businesses, I read through some comments and saw reference to &lt;a href=&quot;http://projectpier.org&quot;&gt;Project Pier&lt;/a&gt;, a fork of Active Collab.  A new .8 release fixing some bugs and adding a few features to the .7.1 release of AC was out, so I snagged a copy and installed locally.  Very easy to install  (assuming you meet the server requirements), and after a quick read of how to change the god awful default theme, I was up and running, in a familiar PM environment.  I set up projects for my two themes, added some milestones, todo lists, poked around and decided that though I‚Äôm the only one using it, I could easily use the messages for personal notes.  And if I ever decide to put it on my own domain for others to collaborate with, I can easily migrate the database, and keep my current work intact.  It also seems powerful enough that a small design house or programming team could use it for real projects, as it supports file uploads and RSS feed for recent activity.  I haven‚Äôt explored email notification, however I believe it handles that ala Basecamp as well.  (Like Basecamp, I don‚Äôt think you can reply to a message via email however)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very useful tool, and I‚Äôd like to applaud the team behind Project Pier for picking up and forking in light of the changes in the development of Active Collab.  I‚Äôll be keeping an eye on it‚Äôs progress, and am looking for good things to come.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Harvest Field - A New Habari Theme</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:  New versions now available. See bottom of post for details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/HF_screen-shot.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Wanting to work on &lt;a href=&quot;/mzingi&quot;&gt;mzingi&lt;/a&gt;, I found myself a little unmotivated, so instead, I thought, maybe I can find an open source design to port to Habari, and that would get me motivated to look at the underlying code.  So off I went, googling, and browsing the many repositories of open source designs, looking for something I might want to use on a personal site, and would be a nice (albeit one of few currently) available themes for Habari.  I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.styleshout.com/&quot;&gt;styleshout&lt;/a&gt;, and their numerous, well done themes.  Ideally, I‚Äôd liked to have found one that hadn‚Äôt been ported to other platforms, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.styleshout.com/templates/preview/HarvestField1-0/index.html&quot;&gt;Harvest Field&lt;/a&gt; so caught my eye, I couldn‚Äôt help but choose it.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
It just had enough fall feel to it, that I set about converting it to Habari.  I wasn‚Äôt enamored with the semantics, and set about using the mzingi markup and code, tweaking for design specific features, which include having asides in the sidebar (tagging a post ‚Äúasides‚Äù will leverage this feature.  The tag can be changed in theme.php), recent comments in the footer column, the user pic and about content you can add via admin/options and editing your user, as well as a new twist, the next 5 most recent posts in the third column.  The nifty part of this feature is that it leverages some Habari internals, and shows you the next five posts if you go backward in the page view, ie page/2 will show you the next 5 posts from page 3.  This is dynamic in the sense that if you are showing 10 posts per page, as set in your options, then it will show posts 11-15 in the footer.  (I will be documenting how this is accomplised in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Habari Wiki&lt;/a&gt; soon.  Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewdasilva.com/&quot;&gt;Andrew da Silva&lt;/a&gt; for the help on this feature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature is the dual colored Blog title in the header.  This is dynamic, in that it counts the number of characters in the title, and does a little math to split it up. You can change it manually by either editing the number it divides by in theme.php, remove it in header.php and use the default &lt;code&gt;Options::out('title')&lt;/code&gt;, or manually add your title wrapping the section you want in light brown in span tags.  Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://incoherentbabble.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Meller&lt;/a&gt; for his assistance on this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future goals are to better style the pagination below the posts, any other suggestions are welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had originally thought about adding a plugin hook in that column to pull a RSS feed, but I eventually thought twice about requiring an external plugin.  You certainly can edit footer.php to add any type of content you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, feedback is welcomed, and I look forward to providing more Habari themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/downloads/Harvest_Field_0.2.zip&quot;&gt;Download Harvest Field 0.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For users of trunk &amp;gt;r1574&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/downloads/Harvest_Field_0.3.1.zip&quot;&gt;Download Harvest Field 0.3.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original design was released with a Creative Commons license (I really need to blog about that), so I haven‚Äôt really addressed a license, suffice to say, do with it want you want code wise, just respect the original author‚Äôs wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After roughly 3 months, the new developer release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://habariproject.org/en/&quot;&gt;Habari&lt;/a&gt; is now available for &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/habari/downloads/list&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;.  I just saw the 0.2 release was downloaded nearly 11,000 times, which I personally think is great, I‚Äôd hope to see double that for the .3 release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release has many &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Releases/0.3&quot;&gt;bug fixes and features added&lt;/a&gt;, for both the coder and user.  Personally, I contributed a fair amount of work on documentation, including my continued work on the manual, as well as getting my coding hands dirty a bit working on the first steps to overhaul the admin interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participating in this community has been one of the few bright spots in my otherwise gloomy year, and I‚Äôd like to personally thank all of those who participate.  I‚Äôve also expanded my ‚Äútech‚Äù knowledge, specifically in relation to using more of the CLI and subversion.  I actually managed to move a repository the other night from my local machine to a new repository on my Media Temple server that they provide.  I‚Äôve now even ventured into using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macports.org/&quot;&gt;macports&lt;/a&gt; to set up my old laptop to be a better mobile development environment, as MAMP for Panther doesn‚Äôt support PHP 5.2 (but that‚Äôs for a future post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, I‚Äôm looking forward to the Habari community growing, and great things to come.  Even if you aren‚Äôt ready to switch blog platforms, I‚Äôd highly suggest downloading and checking it out, and by all means, keep abreast of development.  It‚Äôs a fun and inviting community, with a lot of excitement for what it‚Äôs future holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also stay tuned for a soon to be updated version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/mzingi&quot;&gt;Mzingi&lt;/a&gt;my Habari theme framework, to leverage some of the new features available to themes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prism for Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/11/prism-prototype-now-available-on-mac-and-linux/&quot;&gt;Prism&lt;/a&gt; for mac is out.  Those not familiar, it‚Äôs Mozilla‚Äôs Webrunner app, which basically gives you a stripped down browser to run web apps in, so that you don‚Äôt have to keep multiple tabs/windows open in your browser, perfect for things like gmail, Basecamp, insert your favorite web app here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thunderbird and Gmail IMAP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent buzz around the ‚Äònet about gmail adding IMAP, I was anxious to finally give it a go.  I‚Äôve read a bit about IMAP, but had never had the opportunity to try it out.  My work requires almost constant monitoring of email, and since I employ Google Apps for your domain to manage my email account, and prefer to use Apple‚Äôs Mail, I‚Äôd all but stopped using my old, but reliable clamshell ibook.  Thus the excitement of being able to monitor my email from my laptop, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/nokia-e62-and-the-mac&quot;&gt;Nokia e62&lt;/a&gt;, and the desktop computer.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
After seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/turn-thunderbird-into-the-ultimate-gmail-imap-client.php&quot;&gt;post at Lifehacker&lt;/a&gt; about Thunderbird, I figured it would be worth checking out.  I knew that Thunderbird had reecently been updated; I hadn‚Äôt tested it in over a year.  Being a quasi Mac fanboy, after following the instructions for using TB with the gmail IMAP, I sought a more ‚ÄúApple‚Äù type theme.  The only two I found, were outdated, with a max verson of 1.6.  A  couple of failed attempts to change the version number, I went hunting the intarweb for another version.  (I also was having problems connecting to addons.mozilla.org, lots of times outs.  Not sure if it‚Äôs a latency issue, or what.) &lt;em&gt;(update)seems to be resolved, not sure what the problem was&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few failed links, I found one that works.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twistermc.com/blog/2007/06/26/iv-beta1&quot;&gt;Twister MC&lt;/a&gt; had a beta version that worked just fine.  It‚Äôs not an exact replica of Apple Mail, but certainly a better feel (not that the default TB theme is as bad as the default FF theme).  I‚Äôm still not sold on TB, as it doesn‚Äôt integrate with Address Book, and I haven‚Äôt found a good solution for importing mine into TB, but I certainly like it better on this older Mac than the Panther Mail.  I‚Äôll continue to use TB on the ibook, keeping my eye out for extensions and improvements.  As soon as I can afford Leopard, I‚Äôm sure all bets will be off though on the desktop, as I‚Äôm anxious to give that a whirl.  Any TB extensions I should look for?  I read another post @ Lifehacker, but none of the ones mentioned got my fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;update&lt;/em&gt;: This &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.update.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/421&quot;&gt;MR Tech&lt;/a&gt; will allow you to override the max version check and install either of the more common Apple Mail-like themes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TextMate and Projects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I really, really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; love using TextMate, but I one feature I feel is missing, is the ability to set a project to open on launch.  More often than not, I‚Äôm using TextMate in conjunction with Transmit, and have a project set up to keep temp files from Transmit collected together, using tabs, vs 12 open windows.  I‚Äôd love for that project to be set to open on launch, vs the preference now of just being able to open a blank file.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Installing Ubuntu on my Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/user/images/3_operating_systems.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/user/images/3_operating_systems_sm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The ‚Äúblogosphere‚Äù has been abuzz the last few weeks with news of the latest release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu, 7.10, &lt;em&gt;Gutsy Gibbon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to see if I could install it on my mac mini, since I didn‚Äôt have another machine to try it out on.  I‚Äôm quite happy with Mac OS, but it never hurts to be familiar with other operating systems.  So I thought aloud on the Habari IRC channel if I could use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualbox.org/&quot;&gt;Virtual Box&lt;/a&gt;, which I use to run Windows XP, only so I can test websites in Internet Explorer 6.  Survey said, ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù, and I gave it a go.
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
First step was to download the installer disc from the Ubuntu site, which is in the .iso format.  There are many ways to create an actual CD from this, or a .dmg file, however I didn‚Äôt want to bother with that step, so after another question to the IRC channel, my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://h0bbel.p0ggel.org&quot;&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; said Virual Box should load from the .iso, and quickly found a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/vincentt/416553085/&quot;&gt;Flickr image&lt;/a&gt; showing how to set the VM to load from the .iso. (After you‚Äôve created the new VM, click the settings button, then for CD/DVD-ROM, check the mount CD/DVD-ROM, then check the ISO image, and find the file you downloaded.)  I haven‚Äôt gone through the steps to setting up a new VM in Virtual Box as I just used their wizard for a new VM.  I did give a bit more RAM for the VM than the default setting, as I‚Äôve got 2GB, and won‚Äôt be using the VM that often, so figured I could spare some. I‚Äôm sure I did the same thing for the XP install as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the VM is set to run off of the .iso, I started the VM, and Ubuntu quickly loaded, with a prompt to Install/Boot from disc (I think that‚Äôs what it said), hitting enter, Ubuntu booted up.  You can run just off of the CD image, if your curiosity is small, however, you can actually run the installer from the icon on the desktop, to get the full experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the installer walks you through the basic installer, not unlike installing Mac OS or Windows.  The installer took just under an hour in the VM from the CD image, I‚Äôm not sure more RAM or an actual CD would have sped the process up or not.  After the installer is done running, you will be prompted to restart, with a notice to eject the CD, so that you don‚Äôt run off of the CD.  Since Virtual Box is set to use the ISO, you will need to shut down the VM, change the setting to use the host CD/DVD-ROM, and restart the Ubuntu VM.  You should be prompted to enter your username and password that you set up during the installation process, and Ubuntu should now be running in your VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial reaction to Ubuntu 7.1 is that it‚Äôs a mix of Tiger and Windows XP in feel, maybe 75% Mac, 25% XP.  I haven‚Äôt explored much more yet, but have looked a bit at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtoforge.com/the_perfect_desktop_ubuntu_gutsy_gibbon&quot;&gt;tutorial for the ‚Äúperfect desktop‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;, and will certainly poke around.  I think I‚Äôm more interested now in exploring virtual machines, and other operating systems than I am with playing with Ubuntu, however, I don‚Äôt see myself leaving Mac OS any time soon.    Feel free to comment if you have any problems with Virtual Box, though I only have a basic understanding of it, but I‚Äôll try to share my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

I spend so much time of my day in Firefox, it only seems logical to find a solution that would allow me to manage drafts and posts from within the browser.¬† Particularly for asides and tidbits.¬† We‚Äôll see how this works out, and maybe, just maybe, I‚Äôll actually blog, and not just work on them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;p class=&quot;poweredbyperformancing&quot;&amp;gt;Powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scribefire.com/&quot;&gt;ScribeFire&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mzingi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;updated:&lt;/strong&gt; New versions available.  See bottom of post for details.
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Mzingi development will no longer done on Bloggingmeta, as it‚Äôs now included in Habari‚Äôs core theme directory.  Any bugs, comments, or suggestions should be pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.habariproject.org/habari&quot;&gt;Trac&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had the idea for a foundation type theme for Habari since I first started working with the platform earlier in the year.  After spending time converting k2 to the design for this site, as well as for my &amp;lt;a href=
http://cookingwith.miklb.com‚Äù&amp;gt;cooking site&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, I knew that if I wanted to continue working on Habari theme design, I would need something else to work off of.  No offense at all intended for the developers and users of k2, I have extreme respect for what it has achieved, I simply feel that it‚Äôs conversion to Habari was a difficult task, considering the advanced features in k2, vs being adapted to Habari at such an early stage.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewdasilva.com/&quot;&gt;Andrew (aka freakrz)&lt;/a&gt;, has done great work in advancing k2 to catch up to where the rest of Habari development is, however, I still felt I wanted my own framework to work off of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/mzingi_screenshot.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://miklb.com/user/images/screenshot_thumb.jpg&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That said, I took the initial work I had done here on Blogging Meta, and started working on a purely CSS based theme, that could be used out of the box, as well as be flexible enough to be used as a framework.  I still have a long way to go in the design world, but trying to use all of the reading I‚Äôve done, I think the markup is fairly semantic, HTML strict, and though the CSS validator chokes on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/&quot;&gt;YUI font CSS&lt;/a&gt;, it should be valid CSS as well.  I quite like the simple percentage based font sizing of the YUI CSS, as well as the built in font family cascading.  Again, still plenty to learn in this direction, and perhaps at some point I‚Äôll drop it, but it‚Äôs a good building block (perhaps after getting some time to mature, as well allow me to spend some time with it, I‚Äôll convert to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/&quot;&gt;Blue Print CSS&lt;/a&gt; framework).
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Aside from the YUI CSS, the only other borrowed code is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://andybudd.com&quot;&gt;Andy Budd‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cssmastery.com/&quot;&gt;CSS Mastery&lt;/a&gt; chapter on forms.  However, this will soon be removed, as I want the license for the theme to be completely compatible with the Apache License that Habari ships with, and Andy‚Äôs code is licensed under a Creative Commons share-a-like one. (A completely different subject, which I intend to blog about soon enough.)  However, for the short term, the form is quite nice, and will suffice until I can write my own CSS for it.  There was also a subconscious nod to the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://ifelse.co.uk/simpla&quot;&gt;Simpla&lt;/a&gt; WordPress theme by Phy Ly, though no conscious code borrowed from the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, many thanks to everyone on the #habari IRC channel for tips, tricks, and code help, particularly tinyau for helping with the comment form and ringmaster for help with the tag template code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few notes about the theme.  The theme assumes the use of the tag ‚Äúaside‚Äù for the asides in the sidebar, if you want to change that tag, you would need to edit theme.php and sidebar.php to change the corresponding tag.  Likewise, if you want fewer or more asides or recent comments listed in the sidebar, you will need to edit those values in theme.php.  I tried to comment the file to outline what the various additions are.  There‚Äôs also the addition of the ability to an excerpt, as can be seen on the tag page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado, the first, alpha release of the theme is now available.  I‚Äôm sure minor updates will come soon, but my impatience overcomes my need for perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.2.  &lt;a href=&quot;/mzingi-2&quot;&gt;change log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mzingi-0-3/&quot;&gt;0.3 change notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having some issues with feed after installing feedburner plugin.  The feed link in sidebar is to feedburner, if you so desire to subscribe, use that link for now, I‚Äôll figure out what I‚Äôve done wrong soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*edit&lt;/em&gt;Still issues, so feedburner is deactive for now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UserStyles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme&quot;&gt;Jon Hicks‚Äô Mac inspired Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, but recently noticed the version I was using was outdated, and Google Reader wasn‚Äôt looking so hot.  Off I went in search of an update, and subsequent posts on Jon‚Äôs site, found &lt;a href=&quot;http://userstyles.org&quot;&gt;User Styles&lt;/a&gt;.  Though the site could use some better search functionality, I really like it in the sense that you can easily add styles via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108&quot;&gt;Stylish&lt;/a&gt; extension for Firefox.  I‚Äôve employed &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/custom-style-sheets-and-basecamp&quot;&gt;Stylish for BaseCamp&lt;/a&gt;, and have thought more about how it could be used, User Styles gives plenty to think about now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Last.fm and iTunes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For many reasons, I have not used the streaming music from &lt;a href=&quot;http://last.fm&quot;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.  That is, until today.  I first read a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060507110841475&quot;&gt;hint&lt;/a&gt; on how to use iTunes and Apple Scripts, however, that solution didn‚Äôt work.  Another comment on the hint pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amua.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Amua&lt;/a&gt;, which basically streams the music via iTunes.  Excellent stuff.  I now can stream my last.fm music through my stereo, using the Airport Express.  If you are a last.fm user, by all means, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/user/miklb&quot;&gt;add me as a friend&lt;/a&gt;, or at least check out my musical tastes.  Though still a bit buggy, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/lifestream&quot;&gt;Lifestream&lt;/a&gt; also tracks my most currently played selections.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apple Weblog or iPhone Weblog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Can someone please tell &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuaw.com/&quot;&gt;The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt; to start a new iPhone blog, and leave my feedreader free of half a dozen or more posts everyday about the iPhone?  I appreciate the need for constant updating, but certainly, you don‚Äôt have to post everytime someone who owns an iPhone coughs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Differences in Habari Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that there is quite the difference in how Habari is developed from a PHP standpoint to a design standpoint.  Code wise, most major changes that I‚Äôve seen, a patch was sent out to the community, and comments were made about how it worked, and if it worked within the general scope of where the members and community saw development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has not been the  case, from what I can see, with a current movement to change the entire admin interface.  There was some discussion about the possibility of incorporating &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/&quot;&gt;BluePrint CSS Framework&lt;/a&gt; into the admin interface.  The general consensus was that it wasn‚Äôt a bad idea, but that there were concerns with it‚Äôs compatibilities with all browsers.  In that discussion however, there was no talk of a ‚Äúlive‚Äù redesign of the interface.  Meaning, the admin would be changed in trunk, at small increments, without any discussion of the changes, or the effects of those changes on the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nokia e62 and the Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, a friend with a slightly larger budget than I, bought an iPhone.  Subsequently, they gave me their ‚Äúold‚Äù Nokia e62. I‚Äôve been a big fan of Nokia, simply because most of their phones that I‚Äôve owned were well constructed, worked well with Cingular, and, just &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So quickly I discovered I can now sync my address book and iCal with the phone, which is nice.  I then sought as many means as possible to use the phone with my mac.  One downfall with Nokia, is they do not have a native Mac desktop interface, as they do with PC, but at least they‚Äôve recently added a &lt;a href=&quot;http://europe.nokia.com/A4423135&quot;&gt;Media Manager&lt;/a&gt;, which allows for the addition of a folder in iTunes and iPhoto , in which anything added to that folder is added to your phone.  I won‚Äôt be using the phone much for these purposes, but it‚Äôs a nice addition.  Perhaps I can see myself using it for taking a podcast or two with me for listening to while out and about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another, not so familiar utility, is the Bluetooth File Exchange application in the Utilities folder.  When I was given the phone, I didn‚Äôt get a USB data transfer cable, so I was having difficulty adding applications to the phone.  One in particular, was a fix for sending SMS messages.  They were taking forever to send.  After discovering the File Exchange app however, I was able to navigate to the file on the harddrive, send it to device, chose the phone, and the app showed up as a text message.  Opening the application allowed me to easily install apps or add new themes (even with the new phone, I‚Äôm still suffering from iPhone envy, so I found an iPhone theme, which I actually like much better than the default theme, or any of the other included themes on the phone).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BlogOrlando</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just added a link in the sidebar to an upcoming blogger ‚Äúunconference‚Äù, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogorlando.com&quot;&gt;BlogOrlando&lt;/a&gt;.  I‚Äôve not been to any type of meetup/conference/gathering of other bloggers, and am really looking forward to it.  Not only to just get out of town for a day or two, but to actually meet and talk face to face with other bloggers and web geeks.  I‚Äôll probably concentrate on the technology aspects of the gathering, though I suppose I can sit in on other sessions as they are added and interest me.  I‚Äôm also looking forward to being able to pimp &lt;a href=&quot;http://habariproject.org/en/&quot;&gt;Habari&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone else in the Central Florida area is going, I‚Äôd love to connect in advance, and possibly have someone to ‚Äúknow‚Äù in advance.  There are two dinners, one the night before, and one the night of, so having even a somewhat familiar person to break bread with would be nice, though I‚Äôm fairly good at making new acquaintances and meeting people.  (Probably from years of sitting in bars and chatting up the person next to me.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if anyone has advice for attending an event of this nature, I‚Äôm all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Habari DR2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve already mentioned, this blog is powered by a new blogging engine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://habariproject.org/en/&quot;&gt;Habari&lt;/a&gt;.  A second developer release is out the door, and can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/habari/downloads/list&quot;&gt;downloaded now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer release, it‚Äôs still not guaranteed for everyday, production level blogging, however it‚Äôs stable enough that you can certainly install it and get a feel for how far it‚Äôs come, and where it‚Äôs going.  For the less faint of heart, you certainly can follow along using &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/habari/source&quot;&gt;SVN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release among opening up many new features that have been in core for some time, also realizes a goal of having docs shipped with the release.  It was a primary goal of the project from the start, and recent discussion about using the aforementioned TiddlyWiki as a means of distributing the documentation brought me into the fold on that aspect.  Thanks to the initial work by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brokenkode.com/&quot;&gt;Khaled&lt;/a&gt;, including customizing the CSS to match Habari‚Äôs proposed new admin interface, I was able to incorporate the basics from Habari‚Äôs wiki, and do some initial leg work on getting license agreements to use some TW community released plugins for future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say it is quite satisfying to have contributed in some meaningful way to such a project, and certainly fueled the fires to more actively involve myself in documentation writing for the project, as well as any other positive contributions I can make.  I‚Äôd really like to thank all of the project members, and additional community members who‚Äôve brought Habari this far, as well as in general thank them for creating such a welcoming community.  At this juncture in the development, it‚Äôs quite refreshing for there not to be a divide between users and coders, unlike an unnamed project I volunteered with in the past.  This certainly is a goal for Habari, and I sincerely believe them when they say it will continue in that fashion.  Alienation is the quickest, surefire way of loosing morale support and non code contributions to a community, and as I said, I whole heartedly believe the core of Habari understand that, and will avoid the culture of elitism that I‚Äôm sure permeates many other open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for something new to get your thoughts onto the web, I‚Äôd seriously suggest considering Habari and getting involved in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Experiences with TiddlyWiki</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently it was suggested that the Habari project think about using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiddlywiki.com/&quot;&gt;Tiddlywiki&lt;/a&gt; as a means to ship documentation with new releases.  At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure about the idea, but after about 15 minutes of working with it, I was hooked.  For those not familiar with Tiddlywiki, it‚Äôs a very light weight (single file) mini wiki.  I‚Äôve seen it described as ‚Äúguerrilla‚Äù wiki, or the ‚Äúipod nano‚Äù of wikis.  It highly leverages javascript to hide and show ‚Äútiddlers‚Äù, or the individual entries.  With lots of available plugins and custom themes, not to mention a very active community, TW is certainly a great contribution to the web community, and something worth checking out.  Those that are into the Getting Things Done, there‚Äôs a couple of GTD inspired adaptation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shared.snapgrid.com/index.html&quot;&gt;GTDTiddlyWiki, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://monkeygtd.tiddlyspot.com/&quot;&gt;MonkeyGTD.  There‚Äôs also a FireFox extension, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiddlysnip.com/#About&quot;&gt;TiddlySnip&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to save snippets to your TW as a scrapbook of sorts, though I haven‚Äôt tested this extension yet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formatting in TW is different than MediaWiki, though it‚Äôs fairly easy to get used to.  There‚Äôs also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinswiki.com/prereleases.html#MediaWikiFormatterPlugin&quot;&gt;MediaWiki formatter&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to use that formatting in your TW (which is handy if you are copying info from a MW page.  The same plugin author is working on an importer, which I am investigating, which actually allows you to scrape MW entries right into your TW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I find TW a great tool, and something I will continue to work with for a variety of uses, and hopefully will open my eyes to learning more javascripting along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>8apps Invites</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Though there are many ways to socialize on the net (too many), I recently revisited this invite only site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://8apps.com/&quot;&gt;8apps.&lt;/a&gt;  They‚Äôve added a few more apps to the planned 8, so there‚Äôs a few more things to check out.  Not meant as a review, as I honestly haven‚Äôt spent enough time on the site to give justice, suffice to say it‚Äôs a very slick site, with a lot of potential.  It‚Äôs simply up against stiff competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if you‚Äôd like to check it out, I‚Äôve got 40 odd invites available, just leave a comment and I‚Äôll be sure to send one.  Only thing I ask is that you after sign up, look me up (miklb) and add me as a contact, as the system doesn‚Äôt automatically add invites to your contact list.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Custom Style Sheets and Basecamp</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve mentioned that I primarily use BaseCamp these days with the company that I work with to manage the many sites they handle.  That‚Äôs all good, but whenever I log in, I am overwhelmed with many, many, late milestones and upcoming milestones.  Sure, some of it‚Äôs relevant to me, however most is not.  Even what is relevant, I‚Äôm well aware of my tardiness.  I don‚Äôt need a constant reminder :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter a handy little Firefox extentsion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108&quot;&gt;Stylish&lt;/a&gt;, that I became aware of after adopting Hicks Designs handy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme&quot;&gt;Mac OS styled Google Reader style sheet&lt;/a&gt;. (Note, there are instructions for using the style sheet with other browsers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another quick use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60&quot;&gt;Web Developer extension&lt;/a&gt; (I couldn‚Äôt live without this extension), I was able to determine the class of the milestones on the dashboard (.milestones - go figure), and add a quick display:none to a custom style for the company‚Äôs Basecamp dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stylish extension easily offers you the option of using the style for a URL, a domain, or a global style, so I can be sure that it‚Äôs only being used where and when I want.  The extension author recommends using the !important declaration, however I found no need for that with Basecamp.  Certainly worth checking out if you are looking to hide some annoying element of a site you often visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;: I went ahead and changed my style to only drop the upcoming milestones, and left the overdue ones there, as that seemed more relevant to my job.  The class for that is .Dashcal.  That way, I can still see what‚Äôs overdue, and potentially avoid issues.  Upcoming milestones I‚Äôll leave to the project manager to advise on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tracking Time Spent on Email</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I work with a company that uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://basecamphq.com/&quot;&gt;BaseCamp&lt;/a&gt;, which is great.  Each project is easily separated, has it‚Äôs own todos, writeboards, etc.  But as someone who works with all of the projects, I get cc‚Äôed on every message posted.  Some require my attention immediately, some will require me to be familiar with the project at some point.  I‚Äôve never been able to manage my time recording for this internal activity, and I know I‚Äôve lost a few dollars because of this. SO today, I‚Äôm testing out a new system.  I‚Äôve set my mail app (Apple Mail), to only check mail once an hour.  I then set up a mailbox just for these emails, got a timer on the dashboard, that can be started and stopped, and will start the timer, read the emails, follow up on BaseCamp on any immediate issues, pause the timer, and wash, rinse, repeat the rest of the business day.  At some point I‚Äôm going to have to decide that this company has business hours, (I work from home), and not read anymore messages until the next morning, where I can track the time.  I figure after a week or so, I‚Äôll have a pretty good idea of how much time I‚Äôm spending on this, and might actually be more productive, as I‚Äôm not constantly logging into BaseCamp to see what new has been posted, and reading messages that have already been sent to my inbox.  I also hope that after a week or two, it will be a habit, and I‚Äôll have a pretty good average of the time spent, so I can simply log those hours either weekly based on the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read a ton of productivity blogs, (which can be counter-productive, go figure), and it seems little issues like this always trip people up.  I know that the GTD ethos is if you can do it in under 2 minutes, then do it, but that‚Äôs assuming you‚Äôre not getting 10 messages an hour, each with their own 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully in a week or two I can report back on how the little experiment went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit:&lt;/em&gt;Funny one of those blogs I mentioned has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifedev.net/2007/07/procrastination-email-deadly-combination/&quot;&gt;little post about email and procrastination&lt;/a&gt;, certainly appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Speaking of BaseCamp and GTD...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My previous post mentions BaseCamp and GTD, what I‚Äôd really, really, (no, really) like is a way to export my todo‚Äôs from BaseCamp.  Most specifically, to the new Omni Focus, or even better, iCal, which then could be exported to some other format, be it Google Calendar, which supports Remember the Milk, or, as I mentioned, Omni Focus. (Which reminds me, I haven‚Äôt been using it as much as I‚Äôd like, due to the the subject of this post).  Perhaps if my new system works out, I can use the quick add from Mail.app to OF as part of the system‚Ä¶hmm, might just work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More About Email</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So quickly I‚Äôve discovered (or been reminded), that using a Mail.app rule to move right out of the Inbox removes the notice in the dock.  Not a big deal, but if I‚Äôm away from the computer when the hour is up, I might not see that I have new work email, so I‚Äôve employed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonyallevato.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=13&amp;amp;Itemid=29&quot;&gt;Mail Badger&lt;/a&gt;, so that I can create a custom icon notice in the Mail icon in the dock just for that work‚Äôs email.  So far so good though with the system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that Technorati finally was able to index the site, as well as fix the issue with the site regarding new claims for sites not supported with the their quick claim.  Not sure why I was actually waiting for the claim before blogging more here, but it worked out, as I was out with a medical issue the past few weeks, so timing is everything.  I really look forward to blogging, and now I have no excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://h0bbel.p0ggel.org/2007/06/27/technorati-claim-or-blame/&quot;&gt;Christian(aka h0bbel)&lt;/a&gt; for expressing a similar concern about Technorati‚Äôs handling of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Technorati Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that Technorati finally was able to index the site, as well as fix the issue with the site regarding new claims for sites not supported with the their quick claim.  Not sure why I was actually waiting for the claim before blogging more here, but it worked out, as I was out with a medical issue the past few weeks, so timing is everything.  I really look forward to blogging, and now I have no excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems Habari can‚Äôt use Technorati‚Äôs quick claim process, so I was asked to paste a little code in a post, so the claim process could proceed.  Hopefully this will be quick.  I will say that Lev with Technorati was very nice and apologetic regarding the issue, and offered any more assistance necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OmniFocus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got my invite for the alpha testing (yes, alpha, not beta) of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/&quot;&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;, and I can say with certainty that I love it, and am ready to buy it now.  It just seems to be intuitive enough with just the right amount of features (and it‚Äôs not done).  I certainly hope that the main interface doesn‚Äôt get clogged up like many other GTD apps have done trying to be too many things to too many people.  I especially like that you can group projects.  I‚Äôll blog more once I‚Äôve really had a chance to dig into it a bit more, but if you are Mac using GTD‚Äôer, you really should &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/listinfo/omnifocus-beta-announce&quot;&gt;sign up for the beta-announcement list&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you are not happy with the other options out there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>h2 tag inside anchor tag</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm confused. I set an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt; h2 &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag with an #id, and give it a background image.  I want both the image and the text to be a clickable link.  Thus, I want to wrap the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt; h2 &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt; the anchor tag.  Validator tells me it‚Äôs not valid HTML.  I set the anchor to a class of .block, which is defined as &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;.block {display:block}&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;.  Still doesn‚Äôt validate.  Do you see the logic? Or, am I just making a mistake?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Live Designing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the true spirit of blog design, I‚Äôm doing it live on the site, vs working offline.  Not that anyone really ventures to this domain yet anyway.  If you have stumbled in, thanks, and hopefully things will be functioning normal by the end of the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Designing with Grids</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been reading more and more about the concept, and have tried using some Photoshop tools for helping with the concept when doing up a layout mock, but watching and listening to Khoi Vinh and Mark Boulton talk about it from their session at the SXSW Interactive helped immensely.  You can read more about Khoi‚Äôs presentation, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2007/0318_oh_yeeaahh.php&quot;&gt;download the slides in .pdf format on his blog, Subtraction&lt;/a&gt;, and download the podcast from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://2007.sxsw.com/blogs/podcasts.php/2007/05/&quot;&gt;official SXSW site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;scroll down about 2/3 of the way for the link&lt;/em&gt;.  Certainly a lot of good information in the comments on the blog as well, particularly links to books about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>For Real This Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;OK.  I‚Äôm officially going to start blogging here at bloggingmeta, to what ever degree that means.  It may just be a few things web related, and setting up a lifestream, but I will relegate my personal domain for just that, personal blogging, be it political or what not, but all things internet/blogging/web related will go here.  I‚Äôm really excited about using Habari, and have wanted to start using this domain for some time.  Now that the DB is somewhat stable, and not as many chances of having to dump the db, I think I‚Äôll be fine.  Here‚Äôs to the rest of my life while I‚Äôm at it.&lt;/p&gt;

I no longer am cooking for a living, not going to school, and trying to make a go of it doing web design/consulting.  Thinking back on it all, I‚Äôve come a long way, and look forward to where things go.  To any and all who‚Äôve visited and commented, thanks.  I‚Äôve recently tried to blog more in general, and also realized that the site is in need of some overhauling, as I‚Äôve not really done much with the design/updating in almost a year.  So as soon as I crank out a new design for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinylittledots.com&quot;&gt;Tiny Little Dots&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôll focus some spare time on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gravatars 2.0 and Skippy's Gravatars Plugin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had heard that &lt;a href=&quot;http://site.gravatar.com&quot;&gt;Gravatar 2.0&lt;/a&gt; had been released, but hadn‚Äôt really paid much attention.  Today, while doing a little housekeeping around the site, I noticed that none of my gravatars were showing up.  After doing a little investigating, I realized it had to do with caching, among other things.  First thing I did was dump the cache on my gravatars folder in wp-content.  Second, I logged into the gravatar site, and re-associated my gravatar with my email that I use for that account.  Still no gravatars, mine, or anyone else‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I looked at the settings on Skippy‚Äôs gravatar plugin (which I like as I can set a local gravatar, vs using a default one from the original site), it was set to use caching.  I turned that setting off, and voil√°, gravatars are showing back up.  Hopefully that could help someone else (though, from reading a few blogs, and the comments on the main site, there‚Äôs no guarantees the main site will be with fail).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing out Ecto, a desktop blogging client.  I had only tried MarsEdit, and at the time there was no option for tagging.  Now that UTW supports inline tags, this should be a better option.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WordPress Blank Theme V2beta</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I‚Äôm in a blogging flurry, I figured I‚Äôd go ahead and share my newest ‚Äúblank theme‚Äù.  I do quite a bit of WP work, either converting open source designs, modifying existing site‚Äôs design to a WP theme, or custom work, and often have the use for a framework to start.  For the past couple of years, I‚Äôve been using my popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/my-site/blank-wordpress-theme/&quot;&gt;Blank Theme&lt;/a&gt;, but more and more, I‚Äôve found the markup not to my liking, and as it‚Äôs based on Kubrick, a bit outdated code wise.  So I‚Äôve cooked up a blank theme from scratch, using much more (hopefully) semantic markup, and a much more streamlined framework.  This version currently only has an index, header, footer, sidebar (as an unordered list, which &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be widget ready, though I would need to add a function.php file.  It also includes a bit of code handy for recent posts), single post, and page template.  I also am using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianmontoya.com/2006/10/15/full-featured-commentsphp-template-for-wordpress/&quot;&gt;Christian Montoya‚Äôs comment template&lt;/a&gt; instead of Kubricks.  I hopefully covered all the elements in the templates in the style sheet, as well as have a few basic global elements set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, this is a &lt;strong&gt;blank theme.  It is completely unstyled, and is meant as a framework in which to customize a theme&lt;/strong&gt;.  Also, this is meant for WP &amp;gt;= 2.1.x, as it uses several new template tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:  Download link fixed. (damn typos)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blankv2beta.zip&quot;&gt;Blank Theme v2 beta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate any and all feed back, both for missing elements, and suggestions for additions.&lt;/p&gt;

I first discovered Zippy while living in Denver in the early 90‚Äôs.  it was a daily comic in the (&lt;strong&gt;I think&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;em&gt;Rocky Mountain News&lt;/em&gt;.  Not long after, being a casual fan of alt-comics, I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fantagraphics.com/&quot;&gt;Fantagraphics&lt;/a&gt;, and then soon after they published several collections of Zippy comics.  I still own the first 3 issues of the collection somehow (the time soon after moving back from Colorado can be a bit hazy, to say the least).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/user/files/zippy_02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zippy&quot; /&gt;I don‚Äôt even begin to consider myself a Zippy fanatic, and have barely kept up with the comic since those days, but I can‚Äôt help but &lt;strong&gt;l&lt;/strong&gt;augh &lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;ut &lt;strong&gt;l&lt;/strong&gt;oud when ever I type those three letters on IRC.  No matter how bored, frustrated, or confused I might be with my situation at hand, good ol‚Äô mzuri and his Zippy quotes pick me up, and break the ice just enough to keep going.  So the next time you are having a rough time just think of your Zippy, and quotes like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Wouldn't it be great, Zip, if th' spirit of Halloween could last all year long?&quot;

&quot;Yow! A never ending orgy of apple-bobbing and miniature mars bars!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Not as Painful as I Thought</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So if anyone has an ‚Äúold school‚Äù flickr account, they too received an email a while back saying that as of March 15th, they needed to merge with a yahoo id.  I had a yahoo id, which I never really use.  And like most people, they are probably a bit attached to their online identities.  Obviously, I use miklb where ever I can.  I was a bit upset at the prospect of losing my flickr account of /miklb.  Granted, the yahoo account I have is miklb.online, but somehow that just isn‚Äôt what I wanted.  So I procrastinated in making the switch.  Finally, today, I went about looking into it, as I didn‚Äôt want to get locked out of my moblog images.  (Currently, I do not have a cell service with a camera phone, but not all of those images are still on my old phone, anyway‚Ä¶) I went to the flickr account, and saw the ‚Äúmerge‚Äù accounts option.  I went to merge miklb with yahoo id miklb.online.  No go.  miklb.online was already associated with flickr.  Ugh.  When did I do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So looking at that account, I hadn‚Äôt actually uploaded any images, so I saw I could delete the flickr account for that ID.  I didn‚Äôt know if I could then re-associate it, but what the heck, I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot.  I deleted the yahoo id from flickr, and tried again to merge, still thinking I‚Äôd become miklb.online.  In the meantime, I found a flickr export app for the Mac, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunkencity.org/flickrbackup/&quot;&gt;Flickrbackup&lt;/a&gt;, grabbed my images just in case, and then made the association between the old school account and the yahoo id.  All went smooth, and to my surprise, I get to keep the miklb account, I simply now log in with the yahoo id.  Excellent.  Perhaps this will move me to use flickr a bit more, I know I‚Äôd love to get a friend of mine to use it, but he‚Äôs a myspacer, and I don‚Äôt even know what he‚Äôs using to host his images.  (Goody Goody, I‚Äôll even set you up with a blog if you make the switch from myspace).
So, long story short, it was far less painful to make the switch, and if you haven‚Äôt done so, fret not, if you have to be pumpkinpatch6969 instead of your favorite handle, you‚Äôll not loose your flickr name.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No Longer a Champion of Metro PCS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve long been a customer and ardent ‚Äúword-of-mouth‚Äù supporter of Metro PCS.  Heck, they even added web browsing (albeit a handcuffed version).  However, after my experience with their customer support today, I can not advocate the company, or will no longer be a customer.  I‚Äôve always wondered if their business model was really aimed at low-income people looking for a quick and easy cell phone option, and now I think that‚Äôs the case.  A genuine desire to hang onto long time customers certainly wasn‚Äôt in my experience today.
Long story short, I‚Äôm a procrastinator.  I simply wait until the last minute to pay bills.  Certainly I‚Äôm working on fixing that defect, see my post about GTD and a desire to at least &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that a bill is due.  So last night I tried paying my bill, the last day.  Nothing uncommon on my end, I‚Äôve done it routinely since I got the service.  However, last night, I couldn‚Äôt process the online payment gateway.  Tried again today, still no luck, so I called their payment service customer support.  First agent said turn off pop-up blockers.  I explained I‚Äôve never had that issue before, but humored them and tried.  No luck.  I call back, this time I‚Äôm asked, ‚Äúare you using FireFox Mozilla?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, I replied. Nut shell- they stopped supporting Mozilla.  No explanation, just, ‚Äúuse IE.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I started this some time ago, and it‚Äôs been sitting as a draft, so I figured I‚Äôd wrap it up as I just mentioned Flickr and mobblogging&lt;/em&gt; 
After I let the account lapse, I procrastinated some more, not signing up with another service, to the point I figured I‚Äôd go ahead and keep Metro PCS for a little longer.  I paid my bill, (approx a month later) and service was back on.  The next morning, I get a text message saying I need to pay another $60.  So I try calling them to find out what was going on.  I probably spent an hour just finding a phone number where I could speak with a human being.  I finally had to call an authorized reseller in St. Petersburg (I live in Tampa) to get a number.  They informed me that though I don‚Äôt have a contract, their policy is that you pay for the month of service, even if the phone wasn‚Äôt in use.  I said that was unacceptable, and wanted a refund.  That I did get.  But never in the whole process did anyone acknowledge that the whole issue arose from their poor web interface, and offer to simply waive a month, or any reconnect fees to keep me as a customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some irony to that is that when ever I would end a conversation with a rep, they would say ‚Äúwe value your business here at Metro PCS‚Äù.  Did they really?  I think not.  I highly suggest looking at other alternatives to their service, as I do not think they care about long term customers, and are more in the business of short term, ‚Äúturn and burn‚Äù clientele.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Following Up on GTD</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, two months into the year, and I‚Äôm still struggling with a good GTD system.  I am using Actiontastic still, but for work, I‚Äôm using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshbooks.com&quot;&gt;Fresh Books&lt;/a&gt; to time track and invoice clients.  (For those that care, I‚Äôve gone full time into web work.  Mostly WordPress, but I‚Äôve done a fair amount of non-WP work.  My working site is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bishopblogworks.com&quot;&gt;Bishop Blog Works&lt;/a&gt;. Please understand the design is in flux).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh Books is great, but I can‚Äôt get my clients to use the ticket system.  Email is still their method of choice for notifying me of needed changes, for both active projects, and site tweaks.  Fresh Books says they will have an email to ticket system, but if that doesn‚Äôt materialize sooner than later, I may have to look at another option.  In the meantime, I try to take the email, add it to iCal as a todo using &lt;a hfref=&quot;http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html&quot;&gt;Mailtags&lt;/a&gt;, then sync iCal with Actiontastic, and THEN add those as tickets/tasks in Fresh Books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not working out so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, I‚Äôve streamlined the home office, clearing out a lot of clutter, which I believe makes it easier to get started in the morning and stay focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a suggestion for converting emails to a time tracking system, I‚Äôd love to hear about it.  I have started looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://kingdesign.net/tasks/&quot;&gt;Alex King‚Äôs Tracks &lt;/a&gt;, as it has an email to task ability, but the demo doesn‚Äôt seem to allow for that.  It requires running a cron job on your server, and since Alex is setting the demo up on his, I don‚Äôt see a way to test that feature.  If it works, I could have clients send an email that is picked up by Tasks, and then time track straight from that.  But then I‚Äôm back to either having two ‚Äúapps‚Äù for time tracking/invoicing.  Hopefully Fresh Books will roll out that feature soon, and I‚Äôll be good to go.  I then simply forward a copy of the ticket to Mail.app, add it to Actiontastic, and it‚Äôs automatically added to a ticket.  Or at least that‚Äôs how I‚Äôd draw it up on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Running with Habari</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/habari/&quot;&gt;new blog engine&lt;/a&gt; to get the blood pumping.  Not that I‚Äôm jumping ship, just looking to broaden horizons, and see what new and exciting might be around the corner.  I‚Äôm a big fan of a couple of people involved, not such a fan of a few others.  But that‚Äôs part of community.  But really I‚Äôm just testing out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://habari.bishopblogworks.com/laymans-guide-to-installing-on-a-small-orange&quot;&gt;trackback feature&lt;/a&gt; on the most recent build.  So really, just ignore this post‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Year and Getting Things Done</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first of probably several posts for, primarily my own benefit, documenting my implementation of the GTD system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, a bit late in getting a ‚ÄúNew Years‚Äù post up, but I‚Äôm fighting a heavy does of procrastination and a head cold, so I thought ‚Äúno time better than the present‚Äù.  Several months ago, I discovered Merlin Mann‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.43folders.com/&quot;&gt;43 Folders&lt;/a&gt;, probably via a link from a Mac site.  There I found my first introduction to the concept of ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù, which is a book and much more from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidco.com/&quot;&gt;David Allen.&lt;/a&gt;  Like most people, I find myself constantly feeling unorganized, confused, and wrought with anxiety as I‚Äôm not ‚Äúgetting shit done.‚Äù  So I began reading some posts, exploring the multitude of applications discussed, and ‚Äúlurking‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first application that I explored, which isn‚Äôt directly a GTD app, but one meant to provide more productivity in using your Mac was &lt;a href=&quot;http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/&quot;&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;.  This free application really is something that should be built into the OS, but that‚Äôs for another discussion.  Suffice to say, once you get a hang of the app, you may never really touch your mouse or use the dock again.  (Well, not really, but it is safe to say you will use the mouse much less, and the dock, well, that can be eliminated.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, I began reading more and more about the GTD concept, and decided it was time to get the book.  My frugal nature led me to my local library, however, the waiting list for the book was 57 people (I‚Äôve yet to be notified by the library that a copy was available for me).  So procrastination took over, I blew off several trips to the book store, and I continued my struggle with knowing what I needed to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on New Years Eve, my muse purchased the book for me, and I immediately began reading.  It was as if the book had been written for me (I‚Äôm sure most people feel that way upon first reading).  I‚Äôm not going to try and explain the concept, I don‚Äôt think I could do it justice, but a brief overview is that it‚Äôs intended to get ALL the things that people generally keep in their head, be it work, home, or personal, and put them into a system that allows to track them.  It also introduces the idea of breaking ‚Äúprojects‚Äù, that is, anything that has more than one step, into ‚Äúnext actions‚Äù.  So instead of having a to do list with ‚Äúlandscape yard‚Äù item, you have a project, and then steps to accomplishing the task.  The goal is to remove those from your head, those nagging, ‚ÄúI know I should be doing‚Ä¶‚Äù type things, and allow you to concentrate on the ‚Äúdoing‚Äù.  This should alleviate the stress and anxiety from the daily routine.  Sounds perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to find a system that works for you.  David Allen doesn‚Äôt necessarily have a specific system, just a concept.  Many, many systems exist, some paper based, some electronic, some a mix.  As I work completely on the computer now (&lt;em&gt;crossing fingers that sticks&lt;/em&gt;), a computer based system seems most logical.  So off I went looking for a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first stop was a FireFox extension &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gtdgmail.com/&quot;&gt;GTDGmail&lt;/a&gt;, which hacks into your gmail account, and provides for project creation, contexts (that is, ‚Äúwhere‚Äù or ‚Äúhow‚Äù you do the task, @phone, @errands, etc).  It was a good primer on the concept, and has helped in managing my many emails from clients.  However, soon it became clear that wasn‚Äôt sufficient enough for me for the entirety of the GTD system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve looked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://patrickrhone.com/journal/archives/2006/06/189.html&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; for using &lt;a href=&quot;http://backpackit.com/&quot;&gt;BackPack&lt;/a&gt;, which I like, but ultimately, didn‚Äôt seem like the best solution for me.  I‚Äôve also looked at several of the wiki hacks, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kinkless.com/&quot;&gt;Kinkless&lt;/a&gt; system.  Which, seems well done, but as it requires Omni Outliner Pro, I wasn‚Äôt ready to invest in more software.  Apparently Omni Group is working on OmniFocus, a full fledged app implementing what Kinkless does with Omni Outliner, and worth keeping an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to my final decision.  Currently, I‚Äôm using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaboomerang.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Actiontastic&lt;/a&gt;, which is still in beta, and will be an app that will have to be purchased at some point.  It integrates with quicksilver, so I can easily add items to my inbox without actually moving to the app (for instance, while typing this, if I remember I need to buy TP, I can easily send that to the app with a few keystrokes).  I‚Äôve also looked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/&quot;&gt;Tracks&lt;/a&gt;, a Ruby on Rails application that can either be installed locally on my Mac, or hosted on my server.  Hosting it on my server would give me the ability to access it from any computer, and though I haven‚Äôt explored it completely, I‚Äôm guessing now that I have internet access on my phone, I could add items from the phone‚Äôs browser (or at least via email/SMS).  If you are interested in testing Tracks, you can visit a free hosted version at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tracks.tra.in/login&quot;&gt;Tracks Train&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which I choose, the bottom line is I need to now actually implement the system, so I can actually start ‚Äúdoing‚Äù, which is a caveat of sorts.  It really is a matter of dedicating time to do it.  It‚Äôs really not something that can be done in spurts, or half way.  I think that is the real reason for blogging it, a challenge to myself to really get it in gear.  I intend on blogging more about the process, as both a way to share, and a means of archiving the process for my own benefit, especially if a new, or better ‚Äúsystem‚Äù comes along.  I‚Äôve all but decided to go with Actiontastic, so the next step will be to nail down the contexts for my system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSS Mastery From Santa Giveaway</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Santa,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember way back when I was first starting out cooking, and I asked you for a copy of Harold McGee‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Food-Cooking-Science-Lore-Kitchen/dp/0684800012/sr=1-1/qid=1165687755/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-9313929-1151264?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&quot;&gt;On Food and Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.  I was just a hack kid in the kitchen, desperate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.essaylib.com/&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit; text-decoration: none; font-weight: inherit; border:none;&quot; class=&quot;ass&quot;&gt;learn more&lt;/a&gt; about the science behind the art that had all but consumed me.  You quickly obliged, and I took that knowledge on a journey that I wouldn‚Äôt trade for anything.
Now, that I‚Äôve grown, my interests and profession are taking another turn, and again I turn to you to bring me a book that will do for me what Harold‚Äôs did for me back then.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2006/12/win_an_ipod_nano_with_css_mastery_this_christmas/index.php&quot;&gt;Andy Budd&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;amp;path=ASIN/1590596145&amp;amp;tag=blogography-21&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&quot;&gt;CSS Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, yet another brilliant insight into the ‚Äúscience‚Äù behind the ‚Äúart‚Äù that has taken me onto my most current journey.  I‚Äôve muddled my way through so far, but I trust that with the guidance this book offers, I can excel in this medium in a similar manner that I did with my last discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.  If you happen to find room in your bag to add a new Mac Book Pro and a 20‚Äù cinema display, I promise to be a really, really, good boy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quick WordPress tip: Press it bookmarklet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve used the ‚ÄúPress It‚Äù bookmarklet about as long as I‚Äôve used WordPress.  When the feature was originally used in 1.5.x, a new window would open up, and you could reference the original site for what you wanted to use for content.  In 2.0.x, it takes you from the site to your write post panel, which means I either have to go back and re-open the site, or remember what it was I wanted to use from the site.  That is until today.  I accidently had some text highlighted on a page when I used the bookmarklet, and when taken to the write post page, the highlighted text was pasted into post panel.  Cool!  Now I can highlight a blurb for a blockquote, then ‚ÄúPress It‚Äù, and simply add the blockquote html tags and finish the post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Humbling Attention</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôve had this site for a while, I‚Äôve become less and less of a stats whore, but at least a few times a month I check my referrer logs.  The past month or so, I‚Äôve been linked to by two separate design showcase sites.  The first, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cssliquid.com/2006/gallery/miklb%e2%80%99s-mindless-ramblings/&quot;&gt;Liquid Designs&lt;/a&gt;, showcases sites that use liquid width design.  A lot of this site is based on that concept, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm learning more about.  The second, and more recent is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.designmeltdown.com/chapters/Blogs/Part2.aspx&quot;&gt;Design Melt Down&lt;/a&gt;, part of their ‚ÄúBeautiful Blogs‚Äù section.
I did put a lot of time into this past springs CSSReboot for the site, and have tried to maintain the site despite the lapses in content.  However I would have never expected ANY type of recognition for the work.  So to the operators of the site, and those that have clicked over, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FireFox 2 A Web Developers Friend</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;image321&quot; src=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/firefox-logo-64x64.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox-logo-64x64.png&quot; /&gt;I‚Äôve blogged about my browser issues before, but I just have to share how cool I think FireFox 2 is.  Now with built in spell checker (just right click a word, and suggestions are at the top of the menu, perfect for blogging and email), it‚Äôs quick, totally extensible , and just makes working on line so much more productive.  A few extensions are a must for me, so I had to wait a few weeks for them to be released before I could start testing it, but the wait was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;
First was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1322/&quot;&gt;GrApple&lt;/a&gt; theme.  I loathe the candy-ish default theme, and was quite pleased when theme makers started adding Mac Os-esque brushed metal themes.  I haven‚Äôt taken to the newer Apple look, ie, iTunes 7, so the more subtle brushed metal look of GrApple suites me fine, especially the small buttons in the nav bar.
Then are the extensions.
Some plugins were FF 2.0 ready, such as the indispensable &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/&quot;&gt;Web Developer&lt;/a&gt;.  I‚Äôm a big fan of using tabs, and one extension was borking my tabs.  Uninstalling the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/158/&quot;&gt;Tabbed Browser Preferences&lt;/a&gt; solved the issues.  A better tab manager, &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1122/&quot;&gt;Tab Mix Plus&lt;/a&gt;,  fixes issues with windows opening up instead of tabs (note, I downloaded a RC from the developer site, the new release should up on mozilla in the next day or so).
Another great developer tool is &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/539/&quot;&gt;MeasureIt&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you drag across the screen a box that measures in pixels.  When working out kinks in spacing, this is invaluable.  Also helpful is &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/394/&quot;&gt;ViewSourceWith&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you choose an application (like a text editor) to open a page source with.  Makes finding which line number an error is a snap.  Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/271/&quot;&gt;Colorzilla&lt;/a&gt; allows you to grab hex colors from a site, nice to have if you are trying to recreate an existing site, or simply like a color scheme of a site.
A few other extensions that I recently discovered are &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2104/&quot;&gt;CSSViewer&lt;/a&gt;, which once turned on, allows you scroll around a page, and it shows the CSS for that element, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2625/&quot;&gt;OPML Support&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to import/export your FF bookmarks in an OPML format, which for WordPress users, is nice, as you can import those files into your Blogroll/Links Manager, not to mention RSS reader.
In addition to those, Google‚Äôs Browser sync and toolbar, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cocomment.com/tools/extension&quot;&gt;CoComment‚Äôs extension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1865/&quot;&gt;AdBlock Plus&lt;/a&gt;, make general browsing a snap.
There are literally thousands of extensions out there, with new ones being added all the time.  If you‚Äôve discovered any other can‚Äôt-live-without extensions, I‚Äôd love to hear about them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The San Francisco engineering company's last government contract to rebuild power, water and sewage plants across Iraq expired on Tuesday. Some employees remain to finish the paperwork, but essentially, the company's job is done.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we drop 2.3 billion to do nothing, they see it, and cash in their chips.  Brilliant&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/11/1/192535/983&quot;&gt;Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>But I Want to Vote for the Other Guy!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/local/states/florida/counties/broward_county/15869924.htm&quot;&gt;MiamiHerald.com | 10/28/2006 | Glitches cited in early voting&lt;/a&gt;
So it seems that some early voters in S Florida are having issues with their electronic voting machines.  They tap one candidate, but the other shows on the screen you get to review your choices.  The kicker is that what is being reported in the media is that all incidences are voters who are choosing Davis, yet Crist is showing on the review page.  No media reports that I‚Äôve seen mention the reverse, nor has anyone reported the issue with other offices up for election.  As the Miami Herald article says, this will really get the tin foil cap wearing crowd frothing at the mouth, perhaps this time with cause.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Florida Progressive Information Network</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flpin.net&quot;&gt;www.flpin.net&lt;/a&gt; I was recently contacted about mentioning this site, and after taking a look around, it appears it could indeed be a good way of putting people in touch with organizations that deal with issues they are concerned with.  Basically you choose issues that you are concerned with, a region of Florida, and then the database outputs organizations that match.  You can then sign up for announcements from those organizations, so as to better mobilize concerned citizens.  I didn‚Äôt look at the registration process, but the privacy policy states that all information such as address and name are voluntarily offered, and that they do not share email addresses with the organizations that are linked to from the site. You can sign up with the individual organizations if you care to do so, but that is all done off site from FL-PIN.
The only problem I had was the broadness that organizations can set for their issues.  If I do a search under &lt;em&gt;Protecting the Enviroment&lt;/em&gt;, marine/estuary, the results currently are FCAN and Pinellas Progressives.  Hardly organizations specifically dealing with such a topic.  I would limit organizations to a primary issue, with the ability to choose a few secondary issues.  Especially as the site grows, and number of organizations increase.  Otherwise, the search concept is useless, as all organizations can simply choose all the areas so as to increase exposure.
All in all, the concept though is a good one, and positive tool for citizens and organizations with common goals to find one another.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Friends</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I age, and my path this time around grows longer, it bewilders me the dynamics that occur between us humans.  Even as ‚Äúlife‚Äù continues to get in the way, and forks appear at every turn, people still continue to cross my path.  Such was my evening.  A last minute call, a ticket to a hockey game, and two men I‚Äôm proud to call acquaintances, nonetheless friends, produced a profound feeling.
  A few more forks in the evening (not to mention a couple of High Lifes and Jagers), and I was faced with another question of what being a friend was.
However, I can say without a doubt that the two men that I was privileged to accompany to the hockey game have routinely given me reason to check myself, without any overt actions.  To me, that,  camaraderie aside, is the true nature of friendship.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks guys.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>And the Beat Goes On...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs amazing how going back to work, working 60+hrs a week, and trying to assimilate a day time schedule can wreck any routine one had prior.  I finally got two days off, in a row, to rest and reflect a little on where I‚Äôm heading.  I‚Äôm really looking to establish a little more of a domestic life, call it a goal.  I‚Äôve all but abandoned my WP endeavors the past month, and feel guilty for it.  I simply did not have the mental wherewithal.  My inbox has routinely had 100+ messages, and my RSS feed is about 4000 unread links.  Over the next week, I will catch up on my emails, start working off the RSS, and begin working on my blogs.  My WP blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpstation.com&quot;&gt;WP Station&lt;/a&gt; hasn‚Äôt been posted to in a month, so I‚Äôll try to catch up on the bigger releases I‚Äôve missed, and try and do a re-boot for the fall.  From there, I‚Äôll probably release the theme used there.
I‚Äôm hoping some of those moves will also help me with my personal life, as that has really been a shambles.  From the monumental mistake I made in February, on through the summer, my life has been turned upside down, no really fault but my own.  There is probably no other bad decision I‚Äôve made in my life that I‚Äôve regretted more, and wished I had a mulligan, time machine, do-over, anything to alter the course.
Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt really get those, and I have to deal with the results of my actions, and I guess it‚Äôs time I deal a little more.
But if you are reading this, and you know who you are, I can only say I‚Äôm sorry, I regret that horrible day, and I miss you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sums Up My Feelings Quite Well</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;small left&quot; src=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/bushsteps.thumbnail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bush_steps&quot; /&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;big left&quot; src=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/bushsteps.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bush_steps&quot; /&gt;Hmm, title says it all. Might as well be a copy of the Constitution on there too.  I‚Äôve avoided blogging anything about 9.11, as so much is out there, from the issues with the ABC docudrama, the politicization of the anniversary (for instance, Bush laying the wreath at the site of the WTC, with only Republican representatives with him), etc, etc, etc.  I simply wish that at some point, those that differ on domestic issues, can rationally approach our global issues on a united front, and sanely resolve the conflicts that effect our security, both home and abroad.  I‚Äôd also like to see the powers that be see that the continued death and injury that befalls our military overseas is not a price worth continuing to pay, and find diplomatic solutions to resolve the civil war in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Category Archives Plugin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(disclaimer)&lt;/em&gt;I‚Äôm not a coder, and this is my first attempt, I apologize if this isn‚Äôt properly documented or presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My very first WordPress Plugin!  I‚Äôve dabbled with a lot of areas of WP, but until this &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/86463?replies=2&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in the support forums, I never really had an idea or need to write one.  But after doing some reading, I found that there wasn‚Äôt a simple way to accomplish this task.  All of WP‚Äôs archive features  are based on date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with the help of alphaoide via #wordpress on IRC, I put together this simple plugin to accomplish the task.  It worked fine on my test site, but may need some TLC before being good to go.  Basically it outputs categories by name in an h2 tag, then lists post titles with a permalink to the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested this by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Page_Templates&quot;&gt;Page Template&lt;/a&gt;, then inserting the plugin code within the content div of the theme.
The code to insert is
 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt; ?php mb_cat_archive(); ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
(remove the space between the &amp;lt; and ?, I‚Äôm not sure why that is getting reformatted in the post)
I suppose this could be used in a sidebar, however it may create a very long list‚Ä¶
So to summarize, download the file, unzip, and upload to your wp-content/plugins directory.
Activate the plugin in the dashboard.  Create the page template, inserting the above code, save, and upload to your themes directory.
Go to Write-&amp;gt;Page, and choose the template you uploaded.
The new page should now list your categories with their appropriate posts.
I haven‚Äôt looked into how it handles posts with multiple categories, that will be on my todo list, I‚Äôm sure, if the plugin proves useful or popular.  I‚Äôd also like to add some AJAX to hide the posts until you click on the category (that would make it much more sidebar friendly), and the ability to change the h2 tag to whatever one likes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the file via:

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/features/general/articles/060907fege01&quot;&gt;VANITY FAIR&lt;/a&gt;
What a great idea from a main stream media source.  Vanity Fair has a fake cover for &lt;em&gt;The Weekly Standard&lt;/em&gt; which dogs the current efforts in Iraq.  Simply detach the fake cover from the Vanity Fair, and fold it over a copy on the newsstand, sit back, and watch the shock of the next neocon that approaches the newsstand.  Brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.silvermac.com/&quot;&gt;¬ª Silver Mac&lt;/a&gt; a great Mac tips site, with several recent tips I didn‚Äôt know about.  I really like the recent tip on using a dashboard widget on the desktop.  As much as I like the idea of widgets, I rarely use them as it requires a few keystrokes.  Perhaps if I learn how to use Quicksilver with them‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Quotes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Saw this idea over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kottke.org/06/08/five-quotes&quot;&gt;Jason Kottke‚Äôs site&lt;/a&gt;, and thought it was a fun idea.  Sorta a meme, but not really.  At least there‚Äôs no tagging, &lt;em&gt; yet&lt;/em&gt;.
So here goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot acquire experience by making experiments. You cannot create experience. You must undergo it.
    Albert Camus (1913 - 1960)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself.
    Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only do well the things we like doing.
    Colette (1873 - 1954)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not wealth one asks for, but just enough to preserve one's dignity, to work unhampered, to be generous, frank and independent.
    W. Somerset Maugham (1874 - 1965)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only he is free who cultivates his own thoughts, and strives without fear to do justice to them.
    Berthold Auerbach (1812 - 1882)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Image Links and Hover Background Colors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I did a google search for the solution to a problem I had with some CSS and image links, and didn‚Äôt find a good solution, so I‚Äôm throwing this out there for anyone who might stumble upon it.
The problem I was having was that I was creating a site with a black ground.  There was a global setting for all a:hover links to have a background color and different font color, a common effect.  However, any image links that I had were also getting a small box of the same color at the bottom when I moused over it, not at all good looking.  I tried setting the selector a:hover img to a black backgroud, but the color still showed up.  After closer inspection of my style sheet, I had set a global marign and padding on all images.  When I set those to zero, the color didn‚Äôt show up.  However, I didn‚Äôt want to sacrifice all images to not have to margin or padding, or force the end user to add a special class to images, so I tried setting the a:hover img margins and padding to zero.  The problem there was that the image would ‚Äújerk‚Äù when moused over, as the margin and padding shifted.  So I simply set a img to zero margins and padding, and my problem was solved.  The only down fall is if someone wants to post an image in a blog post that‚Äôs a link, the text will butt right up against it.  However, if that problem arises, I can then set a class for that image, and should be able to give the image room. 
Anyway, like I said, I didn‚Äôt find a solution in the first few pages of google, not that this will make those pages neccessarily, but it‚Äôs worth throwing out there.&lt;/p&gt;

Ha!  So it appears Lieberman‚Äôs campaign whining about being hacked really was a case of being a cheap skate.  Hell, I pay $10 a month to host all my sites.  Republicans, you can have him.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is July Over Yet?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What a horrible month it‚Äôs been.  I‚Äôm finally set up in my new digs with my internet and a environment that I feel comfortable enough to start truly moving forward, no matter how small the baby steps are.&lt;br /&gt;
The worst of it all is a dear man, a troubled genius, someone whom I was honored to call my friend, took his life this week.  I‚Äôm not too comfortable with talking about it yet, perhaps at some point I‚Äôll blog a little more.  I‚Äôll just say that the world took a shot to the kidneys this past Monday evening when my friend Mike O‚Äôneill took his life.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinylittledots.com/wordpress/?p=725&quot;&gt;Tiny Little Dots&lt;/a&gt; has already posted a little more about it, so I‚Äôll leave it to his site to fashion out the extended links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mourn losing Miguel, and I mourn for those who held him even closer than I.  May the next part of the journey bring more solace than the last.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gas Station Conspiracy?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sort of tongue in cheek title, but while pumping gas this week, the thought crossed my mind, do gas stations ‚Äúfix‚Äù the pump so it‚Äôs impossible to stop on a round number?  Obviously this only applies to those who pay at the pump with some sort of plastic, but I‚Äôd guess that‚Äôs a majority of Americans.&lt;br /&gt;
Think about it, a lot of people have some form of OCD weirdness with numbers, and round things to the dollar.  With many years of restaurant experience, I‚Äôve seen it time and time again, people  rounding the bill to the nearest dollar when adding a tip, even if that means shorting the server.  I mean, what really does it matter if your bill is $43.61 instead of $43?&lt;br /&gt;
So back to the pump.  Could it be a trick to get people to spend more money at their pump by making it nearly impossible to stop on the dollar?  Think about it.  You go to the pump, intending on putting $15 in the tank.  As the pump nears $15, you slow down, and do the little shuffle of squeeze, stop, look, squeeze stop, look, ‚Äúdamn, $15.01‚Äù, and the proceed to go to the next dollar.  That could easily happen again at $16, and now you‚Äôre at $17.  Say it stops.  You put the pump away, go about your business, not thinking about the extra $2 you spent that you didn‚Äôt intend to.  If that occurs with 60% of the customers, that could be an extra $1000 or more a day.  That‚Äôs a third of a million dollars a year, easily at the minimum, that they take in that we never intended to spend at that gas station.  So do you think they are doing it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Draft of Park Rules Stresses Conservation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/20/AR2006062001319.html?nav=rss_politics&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;
Trying to catch up on the news after working 35+ hours in 3 days is tough, but this article caught my interest.  Seems the Bush administration has appointed someone who is actually listening, and taking action in preserving our national parks.  I strongly believe the parks should be restricted in the use of motorized vehicles, for many reasons.  I can only hope the draft is taken as it stands, and I intend on adding my comments formally, as there‚Äôs a 90 day window to do so.  I‚Äôll update after I make my voice heard.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yeah, That's the Solution</title>

So a supervisor of elections uncovers more security issues with electronic voting machines, and our elected leader‚Äôs answer is to pass a bill preventing independent testing of the equipment.  Real bloody smart.  I‚Äôm all for technological advancements in all areas of government, but I also want to know that the technology is secure.  Which means testing, and more testing.  Rather than a knee jerk reaction and getting into bed with a company because of questionable lobbying practices, or the like.  I really hope this bill has limited support, and state reps shoot this down quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blogging the NBA Finals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogmaverick.com/&quot;&gt;Blog Maverick&lt;/a&gt;
Mark Cuban, blogger and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is blogging the NBA finals.  I have to say, his blogging has made it infectious to be a Mav‚Äôs fan for the finals.  I‚Äôm not really a basketball fan, but have a few friends who‚Äôve been watching the playoffs, so I‚Äôve followed along.  I also came across Mark Cuban‚Äôs blog while checking out some feeds while investigating over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.opml.org&quot;&gt;Share Your OPML&lt;/a&gt; as the playoffs started.  So I‚Äôve been following his blogs while keeping an eye to the playoffs.  It‚Äôs fun to see things transpire as they have.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deathforecast.com/&quot;&gt;DeathForecast.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the heels of 6.6.06, I find this little web site that calculates your estimated time of death based on a series of questions.  Not the cheery thing, but perhaps a little reality to snap us back into a healthier lifestyle is what we need.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>9rules Network Adds More Blogs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://9rules.com/blog/2006/06/round-4-whats-next/&quot;&gt;9rules Network&lt;/a&gt; has announced &lt;strong&gt;111&lt;/strong&gt; new sites for the network.  &lt;em&gt;111!?&lt;/em&gt;  Before I go any further, let me say, that I‚Äôm not some bitter blogger that was part of the 589 bloggers that were rejected.  I would never consider this blog something for a network.  I don‚Äôt have a niche, I don‚Äôt post enough, I simply rant out loud, and a few people actually read it.  Period. 
But as someone who reads a lot of sites, I once took a site‚Äôs acceptance into 9rules as some sort of validation, that perhaps before reading a post, there was a strong chance that the author was going to know what they were talking about, or that the information would indeed be valid.  But to water down the network, IMO, with that many blogs in one fell swoop, I can‚Äôt help but believe it was a publicity stunt for a group that had recently fallen off the radar, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;
I mean, what better way to get the blogosphere to chatter about you than to ‚Äúaccept‚Äù 111 sites into the network.  How much traffic directly from those sites is generated alone?  Plus those, (I guess I‚Äôm buying into the hype by posting this) who comment on the recent events.  I must say, I really have a hard time buying any of this, and will now take the 9rules logo on a site with a grain of salt, and that is an injustice to those who have been longer termed members of the network.
I‚Äôd like to say I haven‚Äôt looked at all 111 sites, and I‚Äôm sure they are all fine bloggers in their own right.  I simply have a hard time understanding how that many are brought in at once.
I think I might create a snazzy little logo and start my own network.  I‚Äôm sure at least 100 of those 589 that were not admitted are as good in their own right as the 111 picked.  It could be called the Odd Man Out Network.  Wonder how much ad revenue that would generate?  Anyone interested in joining?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When Did This Happen?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôve got an old truck.  And it was bloody hot out today.  Running errands, I see the temperature gauge creeping up.  Ok, needs water.  Not a big deal.  Yeah, right.  Sometime along the way, gas stations simply stopped offering water.  I can shampoo the hell out of my rug, but I can‚Äôt put the third most important thing in the thing to keep it running.  Not just one I tell you, ALL of them.&lt;br /&gt;
I take that back, Shell had some water.  $.75 to use, and it came out by the thimble full.  At $2.80+ a gallon for gas, and record profits for these companies, you‚Äôd think that when they sell you water, you‚Äôd get enough to keep the vehicle running long enough to fill the tank back up.
Self preservation, or something.  Then again, I doubt they really care about those who aren‚Äôt driving around a brand new Escalade‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

Felt good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Firefox Updated - Didn't Ask </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I downloaded the bleeding edge version of Firefox, code name bon echo, to poke around a bit.  Seemed a little snappier, but could have been because 98% of the plugins were disabled.  Turn it off, open my regular firefox, and without asking me, it upgraded to 1.5.0.3.  Bullshit, I say.  I don‚Äôt want the latest version, if simply for the fact that the reason I use FireFox is the extensions.  And this version, the extensions I rely on, are now disabled.  So I might as well use Safari.  I like to wait until the extensions catch up with the release.  And I‚Äôm not at all happy with the new RSS icon in the address bar.  This really was a bad move, and I‚Äôm not sure how it happened.  A really bad taste, that‚Äôs for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; So I‚Äôm guessing they realized that 1.5.0.3 was borked, because 1.5.0.4 is now out, and my extensions work now.  In the meantime, I checked out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caminobrowser.org/&quot;&gt;Camino&lt;/a&gt;, a Mac mozilla based browser, and may just well use that for everyday browsing.  I don‚Äôt like the idea of using more than one, but now that I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.com/scuttle/&quot;&gt;Scuttle&lt;/a&gt; set up on my site, (I used delicious, but don‚Äôt like the idea of Yahoo controlling my bookmarks), bookmarking isn‚Äôt as big an issue with the 2 browser set up.  Camino is faster, FF offers extensions that make working on web sites invaluable.  So I may just become a 2 broswer guy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pelosi Asks Jefferson to Resign from Committee</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/24/AR2006052400350.html?nav=rss_politics&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;
I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Pelosi, but I applaud the token letter she sent out.  So often one side criticizes another, yet fails to follow their own marching orders.  She‚Äôs putting the Democratic Party‚Äôs money where their mouth is.  While well heeled Republicans like the likes of Ney and DeLay held their posts well after annouced charges, with a ground swell of support from the White House down, the Dem‚Äôs are doing what is right.  Step aside, and let the courts sort it out.  Do the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;
Problem is, he &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=politicsNews&amp;amp;storyID=12324027&quot;&gt;won‚Äôt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jesseslife.com/&quot;&gt;jesseslife.com&lt;/a&gt;A guy dropping out of the hustle and bustle, visiting all of the national parks our great country (yes, despite wiretapping, FBI raids on congressman‚Äôs offices, and the like, I still think it‚Äôs a great country) has to offer.  Beautiful pictures, and great insight.  He seems to be about half way through the parks, so I‚Äôm looking forward to the rest of his journey.  I‚Äôve not been to quite as many parks as he, but reading his ventures through Rocky Mountain National Park and Badlands stirred memories of a younger, more bright-eyed miklb driving cross the the plains of North Dakota and Wyoming, down into Denver.  Having grown up with the natural beauty of Florida, the northern plains and the Rocky Mountains were another world.&lt;br /&gt;
I‚Äôm looking forward to the rest of Jesse‚Äôs adventure, and wish him the best in his sojourn.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Spam</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been much buzz the past week regarding comment/trackback spam around the net.  Discussions regarding a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/16/AR2006051601873.html&quot;&gt;cyber spam war&lt;/a&gt;, threads all over the WP support forums, and blog post after blog post regarding spam.  Meanwhile, I sit wondering am I missing out on something?  Do the spammers simply not like me?  I‚Äôve gotten one or two Spam Karma digests, with a few caught spams over the past week, but nothing like the ‚Äú100s‚Äù of spams I‚Äôve seen people mention.  I didn‚Äôt think I was doing anything exceptional to protect against spam.  I‚Äôm running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homelandstupidity.us/software/bad-behavior/&quot;&gt;Bad Behavior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/&quot;&gt;Spam Karma 2&lt;/a&gt;.  No Akismet, the golden child of WP lead developer Matt Mullenweg, no captchas, nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;
Then I wonder, is it because I‚Äôve donated to both plugin developers, that I really do have Spam Karma on my side?  Either way, know if and when I get an adsense deposit, that a portion of it will go again to both plugin developers, just in case ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Saudi Men Board High School Bus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGBMTMWRGNE.html&quot;&gt;TBO.com&lt;/a&gt;
I‚Äôm not quite sure what to make of this, but I have to agree, the substitute driver should have had better training in how to handle riders that seem not to be students.  However, I can also understand the level of concern, and truthfully feel the authorities are handling this in the proper manner.  I don‚Äôt care if they are Saudi or not, two adults boarding a high school bus, and not showing complete remorse when told of what they‚Äôve done requires further investigation.  I‚Äôm not a fan of racial profiling to say the least , however, in today‚Äôs climate, all precaution should be taken.  And as I said, any adult not showing remorse sends a signal to me.  You have to think the driver and students were on the edge of their seat the whole ride, and were happy to see  swarm of police when they arrived at school.  What I hope not to see is a rash of law suits from well to do parents claiming negligence on the drivers part.  That will accomplish nothing, but strap an already over burden school system with legal fees and potentially worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly something needs to be clarified about how to handle similar situations, and at least in this area, better training and incentives for drivers need to be in place, as anytime something ‚Äúscary‚Äù or worse happens, its a substitute driver at the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Moved Again :(</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asmallorange.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/aso.png&quot; alt=&quot;ASO&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alas, I‚Äôve moved servers again, and it‚Äôs not been fun.  Not only am I moving this site and the subdomains, I‚Äôm moving two other domains to the new server.  I‚Äôve ventured into the realm of managing multiple domains.  Yay! (not).  Anyway, it‚Äôs a headache but at least once it‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs done.  A Small Orange looks like great hosting so I shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about this again for a LONG time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&quot;We Know Who You've Been Talking To...&quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/05/federal_source_.html&quot;&gt;The Blotter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It's time for you to get some new cell phones, quick,&quot; the source told us in an in-person conversation...Other sources have told us that phone calls and contacts by reporters for ABC News, along with the New York Times and the Washington Post, are being examined as part of a widespread CIA leak investigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will it stop?  What has to happen for the voices of the sanity and democracy to rise above this administration and reign it back in?&lt;br /&gt;
I‚Äôve not posted about this really, as it seems everyone else has said it more eloquently than I, but at this point, I think people simply need to continue to put it out there, don‚Äôt let it go away with another news cycle about another cute blonde disappearing in the tropics (as sad as the story is, it shouldn‚Äôt be prime time news, &lt;em&gt;every night&lt;/em&gt;).
And instead of coming clean tonight, he‚Äôs going to talk about sending soldiers to the southern border.&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Switching to Feedburner</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve switched my feeds to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com&quot;&gt;feedburner&lt;/a&gt;, for a variety of reasons.  I‚Äôm hoping whom ever has already subscribed (one or two of you at least :) ) will get the new feed with no problems, and I‚Äôm testing it out myself.  I‚Äôve only ever used feedburner for new sites, so let‚Äôs hope this goes off without a hitch.
Speaking of feeds, I recently mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.opml.org&quot;&gt;Share your OPML&lt;/a&gt;, well, I signed up, and it‚Äôs kinda interesting.  I like the similar feeds feature.  It compares your file to others, and then returns a list of people‚Äôs feeds.  So you can read through other‚Äôs list, and find feeds you might interested in.  (As if I didn‚Äôt have enough to read now!)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Super Cool Mac App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If all the other nifty things your mac does isn‚Äôt enough to impress your friends, then the next time you have a party and the music is pumping out of your computer to the stereo wirelessly via the airport express, have this little app running on the desk top, and tell your friends to go pick out an album.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steelskies.com/coverflow/&quot;&gt;Cover Flow&lt;/a&gt; takes your album art from itunes, and makes a virtual CD rack, where you can move from one album to the next looking at the cover, just like the old days :D.  You can click on the album directly in the app, it launches in itunes, and you can can continue to scroll through the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hat tip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://macnewbie.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Macnewbie&lt;/a&gt; for the link&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blogging Identity Crisis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve touched on this topic before, but after the reboot, I‚Äôve found myself wanting to simply ‚Äúblog‚Äù more.  I still have my cooking site, and mentally beat myself up for not using it more, and wonder if simply marrying it with this site is the best idea.  I wouldn‚Äôt feel so compelled to produce content for two different sites, as well as keep up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpstation.com&quot;&gt;WordPress Station&lt;/a&gt;.  I could simply write about food, and food topics interspersed with my political rants, web finds, and occasional fishing stories.  (Those have been few and far between for sure).&lt;br /&gt;
I read more and more blogs these days, and that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm finding, that the sites are not just specific to one topic, that they truly are extensions of the author.  So in a given week, a story about a loved one, web standards, a sporting event, and dinner out can all be intertwined into one site.  As I type this, I feel that is where my direction will go, it just seems to make ‚Äúsense‚Äù.  Less focus on &lt;em&gt;having to&lt;/em&gt; blog about a certain topic, and more on &lt;em&gt;wanting to&lt;/em&gt;.  Because, in the end, isn‚Äôt that what it‚Äôs all about?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bane of My Existence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been a home owner for a little over 5 years, and for the most part, haven‚Äôt thought twice about the decision.  That is, until the toilet acts up.  That damn thing has been nothing short of the proverbial thorn in my side from day one.  Leaking, not flushing, overfilling, you name it, I‚Äôve dealt with it.  And being the ‚Äúmanly man‚Äù that I am, I‚Äôve done all the repairs myself, even when I‚Äôve made huge mistakes like chipping the tank where the fill valve seats, and having to hunt down some kind of epoxy/resin to fill in the chips so the tank would fill and not leak.&lt;br /&gt;
No matter how many times I‚Äôve replaced the ballcock, refill valve, handle, lever, 3 months later this thing stops working properly.  I feel like I‚Äôm a Marine with an M16 when it comes to the thing.  I could take it apart and put it back together blindfolded.  Today wasn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bad, I had to take the ballcock apart, and clean a little gasket inside, reseat it, and adjust the lever to allow the float to rise.
So set the timer, by August, something will &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to be replace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gregarius Update - RSS </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve updated my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/rss&quot;&gt;RSS reader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gregarius.net/&quot;&gt;Gregarius&lt;/a&gt;, to the latest SVN.  Which means the latest code.  Not always a great idea, but this version has been in development for some time, and about to be released as .5.4.  I‚Äôd like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;http://kalsey.com/2006/03/gregarius/&quot;&gt;Adam Kalsey&lt;/a&gt; for his help via IRC, and for his theme.  I really want to look closer at the the theme system, I really think it‚Äôs similar to WordPress‚Äôs system.  Adam‚Äôs theme is definitely an improvement in a lot of ways over the default theme, but I‚Äôd like to maybe soften it up a bit.  For some reason, my eyes just don‚Äôt work with the grays.  Especially the header image.
While I‚Äôm on the subject, I was checking out Dave Winer‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.opml.org/&quot;&gt;Share your OPML&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven‚Äôt added my OPML &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, but I did discover Mark Cuban‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogmaverick.com/&quot;&gt;Blog Maverick&lt;/a&gt;.  I‚Äôm not a big basketball fan, but of all the interviews I‚Äôve seen/read, I‚Äôve found him interesting.  Reading his posts left me with a similar feeling.  I‚Äôve always secretly wished he would buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from the Glazers.  Who knows.  Anyway, I‚Äôm off to the OPML site to find more feeds for my reading pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More Reasons to Halt the Death Penalty</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve not blogged about this topic before, but I came across &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; newspaper articles this morning outlining major deficiencies in the system.  While in college, I wrote an argumentative paper against capital punishment, and I still stand by that stance.  I don‚Äôt believe those convicted of murder should live in the lap of luxury, however I don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve perfected a system to take another‚Äôs life in response to murder.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbusdispatch.com/news-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/05/03/20060503-A1-02.html&quot;&gt;This article from the Columbus Dispatch&lt;/a&gt; details failure in the actual lethal injection process, in which failure to establish an IV led to a prolonged process, that had to be done behind closed doors.
In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/us/03execute.html&quot;&gt;NY Times article&lt;/a&gt;, short comings in the state of Texas‚Äôs method of reviewing deaths by arson.  Currently in Texas, the reviews are made by people who‚Äôve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; attended any formal training in the area.  The article outlines the execution of an innocent man due to the process.&lt;br /&gt;
So mistakes a plenty, no empirical evidence that the death penalty prevents murders, and mountains of tax dollars spent to litigate death penalty cases, can we end this archaic practice now?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thumbnails on Home Page</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This little tutorial is intended as a means of providing WordPress users the means of posting a thumbnail image on their home page, and having a full size image on the single page view.  This is accomplished using the image uploader built into WordPress, and CSS.  If you are intending on using excerpts on the home page, then the addition of Kaf‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://guff.szub.net/2005/02/26/the-excerpt-reloaded/&quot;&gt;Excerpt Reloaded&lt;/a&gt; plugin.  His plugin allows for the inclusion of tags within the excerpt, something the built in function the_excerpt does not.
The first step is to make sure you have the_content or the_excerpt wrapped in a unique div class.  I‚Äôm not sure of the exact correct semantics, but I simply call my home page excerpt   ‚Äúhome‚Äù, and single page div ‚Äúsingle‚Äù. (Note, depending on your theme, you may or may not need to create a separate class for the single page view.  I actually wound up not using single in my theme, as I was able to use the class ‚Äúprimary‚Äù from the original code.  The objective is to have a parent div to call with the specific class we assign the thumbnail).
Next, when you upload your images via the WP upload, be sure to note the path.  Generally speaking, both the created thumbnail and full size image are placed in the same directory.  the difference being the thumbnail file is yourimage.thumbnail.jpg.  So now that you have uploaded the image, and the thumbnail has been created, it‚Äôs time to place both the thumbnail and full size image in your post.  We are going to code the image directly, and not use the WYSIWYG or quick tag buttons, as we need to add a class directly to the image.  Again, not sure about proper semantics, but I used ‚Äúbig‚Äù and small, obviously for the full size and thumbnail, respectively.  Note, if you want to also float the image, you can use two classes, simply leave a space between each class.  An example would look something like this :
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img class=&quot;left small&quot; src=&quot;http://yourblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/image.thumbnail.jpg alt=&quot;image&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left big&quot; src=&quot;http://yourblog/com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Now to create the CSS to hide images on the different pages.
First, to hide the full size image on the main page, we need to add to our style sheet .home .big {display: none}.&lt;br /&gt;
Then to hide the thumbnail on the single page view, we add .single .small {display: none}.
That‚Äôs it.  A couple of simple CSS classes and the built in image upload.  A note about the code.  Depending on your theme, you may or may not need to create a few more templates.  If your theme only has an index.php file, then you‚Äôll need to save a copy of that as single.php then make the changes to that, as outlined.  &lt;br /&gt;
I‚Äôd love some feedback on the semantics of the classes, as that‚Äôs still an area I‚Äôm learning about, as well as any general feedback about the concept.  It works fine for the theme structure I‚Äôm using, but if you run into any problems with your theme, please leave a comment, and I‚Äôll do my best to help you make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, if you notice something awry, please leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Looks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://cssreboot.com&quot;&gt;CSS Reboot&lt;/a&gt; is back online, so a little while from now, hundreds, if not a 1000 or more sites will be officially launching new designs.  A great way to see the freshest designs and ideas out there.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Oh, yeah, I also gave a little face lift to the rarely used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com&quot;&gt;Miklb.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Keeping Firefox Bookmarks in Sync via FTP&lt;/a&gt; had been looking for a way, and finally found it.  Works great with both my ibook and mac mini.  Will look to install on my Windows box as well.
&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;I found this extension to be a much &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2410/&quot;&gt;better version&lt;/a&gt;, that works with 1.5.0.3&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bright House Drops the Ball (or How Not to Conduct Customer Service)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I mentioned I‚Äôm getting a sweet deal on digital phone from Bright House.  In the time since, I‚Äôve had about 6 telephone conversations getting to the bottom of the price.  The day after  I signed up, I received a letter offering me the service for $6.55 less than the night before.  Seems a simple 2 minute explanation that the price offered the night before &lt;strong&gt;included&lt;/strong&gt; tax and fees, the lower price was before.  That they were one in the same.  Meanwhile, I reported to them that once again, I was experiencing poor picture quality on my living room television.&lt;!--more--&gt;  It only happens during the day, and only on the analog channels.  The two previous times I reported this, I was either blown off because at the moment the tech arrived, it wasn‚Äôt happening, and the second time I was told I had a ground problem in the house and that it wasn‚Äôt their issue.  This time I argued that it indeed had to be.  So they said they‚Äôd send out a supervisor.  I had an appointment scheduled for this past Monday.  Well, on my way out the door the Saturday before, the tech shows up.  I inform him my appointment was for Monday, between 11-2pm, that I‚Äôm on my way out and don‚Äôt have time to wait. No explanation on how the scheduling error occurred, and it took a phone call to get the appointment right.
Monday arrives, the same guy shows up, takes a look at things, and says the problem is the modem and TV are on a splitter, that it should never be installed that way.  I then tell him that is exactly the way it‚Äôs been for 5 years, and never  has anyone said anything, including the 2 techs that had been here earlier in the year.  He says he‚Äôll have to schedule someone else to come out and install a dedicated line for the modem.  Fine.  I tell him I have an appointment for the following Monday to have the digital phone installed.  If they can do it at the same time, that would be great.  He leaves, and never confirms any appointment scheduled.  I then have  to call again, to confirm the appointment.  They tell me the dedicated line is scheduled for that Monday, but 8am-2pm.  A different person than the phone.  I ask then if it can be done sooner.  They inform me that Wednesday from 11-2pm.  Fine.  Wednesday rolls around.  11am..12pm..1:15pm‚Ä¶Call comes from the subcontractor‚Äôs dispatch asking me to tell the tech that he left his cell phone behind at a previous install.  I inform them he‚Äôs not here, and ask where he is.  They don‚Äôt know, and don‚Äôt know when he‚Äôll get there.  2pm‚Ä¶I call about a quarter past, get put on hold for 30 minutes to find out where he is.  I‚Äôm told a supervisor has to handle that.  After the half hour hold, they have no idea why I‚Äôm calling, and put me on hold another 15 minutes to find out what‚Äôs going on.  I‚Äôm told it will be another hour at least.  At this point I‚Äôm boiling.  Just as I‚Äôm told an hour, the tech shows up.  He runs into the house, and quickly installs the line.  Fortunately for him, the spot it‚Äôs being installed is close to the side of the home, so there‚Äôs very little crawling under the home.  Nothing changes.  The problem is still there.  Now I‚Äôm fuming.  I wait all day, all year for that matter, and still, no resolve.  I then call back and say I want to talk to a supervisor‚Äôs supervisor.  I get the head honcho finally.  Explain everything to him, he apologizes, but offers no real solution.  There is some exchange between him and the subcontractor over what is supposed to be done, and what the problem is.  The tech informs me that it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúT‚Äù, where my line ties into the main cable.  He leaves, I call the head tech support specialist, and leave a message asking when will things be addressed.  He calls back, and says it will take a day to get some info, that he will call me on Thursday to let me know what is going on.  He never calls.  So today a guy shows up, unannounced, to take a look at the line.  He doesn‚Äôt have to come in, so it‚Äôs not too big an inconvenience, just par for the course at this point.  He comes back and says the problem is in the main line, further to the East.  That all the houses West of me are effected.  Something about a bunch of splices.  At one point he said depending on where the problem is, that it might not be fixed until Monday.  He mentions something about a credit, which is the first time anyone‚Äôs said a word about that.  He doesn‚Äôt say how much, or when.  I‚Äôm still left wondering why the one TV is effected, and not the other, unless its the DVR box that is being effected by the low signal, and the other digital box not.  I have noticed some speed increases in my internet connection.  I used their download test, and the 50MB file settled in at 835Kb/s download.  I‚Äôll be curious what that is after the upgrade Monday to 10Mb/s.  I‚Äôll also be curious what the tech supervisor has to say about everything once it‚Äôs done.  I never want to see someone get in trouble or worse, lose their job, but the tech that told me it was my problem seriously needs to go back to school in troubleshooting.  He didn‚Äôt suggest a dedicated line, nor did he check the signal coming in at the ‚ÄúT‚Äù, to see the problem was outside my line.  Not to mention, when someone calls to say an appointment‚Äôs been missed, putting the person on hold for 30 minutes might not be the best way to handle things.  Verizon is busy putting fiber optic cable in this county, and will have cable and digital phone service soon enough.  My understanding is they are working on a contract with the city.  You can count on me being the first to sign up when that day comes.  Bright House, and Time Warner before them, have routinely been the worst experience I‚Äôve had in dealing with monopoly companies.  It will come back to bite them in the behind, at leas I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hey, HuffPo, a few Suggestions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just removed the HuffingtonPost from my RSS aggregator, as the Vongage ads were the last straw.  It‚Äôs bad enough I can‚Äôt get a feed with excerpts.  I know some people don‚Äôt like excerpts, but a site as prolific as HuffPo (not to mention, the ‚Äúbloggers‚Äù at HuffPo are some long winded essayists)  You miss one day of reading, and there‚Äôs 30+ full length posts to wade through.  Lately, I‚Äôve found myself ditching them anyway without even reading headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not offer a feed of your blog posts in excerpt form without ads.  If the article sounds interesting, I‚Äôll click over the site, and you inundate me with as many ads as you like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Pig Book is Out</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer&quot;&gt;Citizens Against Government Waste&lt;/a&gt; has released their annual report outlining the pork barrel additions to spending bills from Congress.
Some of my favorites are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$3,000,000 for the Animal Waste Management Research Laboratory in Kentucky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,099,000 for alternative salmon products in Alaska - WTF are alternative salmon products?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$6,435,000 for wood utilization research in Alaska, Idaho, Maine, Mich., Minn., Miss., N.C., Ore., Tenn., Wash., and W.Va.  Since 1985, $86 million has been sapped from the taxpayers for this purpose - Um we've kinda got an idea how to use wood, don't we?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,000,000 for the Gaming-Technology Software Initiative in Michigan- huh?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$13,500,000 added by the House for the International Fund for Ireland (IFI), which has released a five-year strategy focusing on grassroots reconciliation and cross-community projects such as:  the construction of Creggan Community Caf√© and Catering Ltd., the Newcastle YMCA, the Donegal Town Waterbus, the Leitrim Food Center of Excellence, the Chef Development Program, and funding toward the World Toilet Summit. - World Toilet Summit, come on...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$46,908 for Hampton Jitney, Inc.  The Jitney is known primarily for shuttling wealthy New Yorkers to their summer homes in the Hamptons. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$4,000,000 for a visitors center at the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska - yet another pork barrell project from Sen Stevens.  What gets me about this one is A, $4 million is a lot for a visitor center, and B, this is a guy who basically wants to ruin another wildlife refuge in Alaska for the sake of oil.  Will the visitor center at Kodiak have pictures of the other, to make up for the loss?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;$21,750,000 added for the National Writing Project, a program established by Congress and developed by the DoE, which aims to enhance the writing skills of grade school teachers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;$100,000 added by the House for the Harpers Ferry Police Department in West Virginia.  The population of Harpers Ferry was less than 400 in 2004 and the police force today consists of two full-time and one part-time police officers..&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;$5,880,000 for the Zora and Main Street Interchange in Missouri- Joplin requested the funding, purportedly to maintain safety and prevent congestion in the town of 50,000 people&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;$500,000 for construction of the Sparta Teapot Museum in Sparta, North Carolina - yep, you read that right &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are just some highlights of the highlights, I‚Äôm sure there are even more mind blowers in there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm liking the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;new look for the NY Times&lt;/a&gt;.  Much better use of space, and optimized for larger displays.  I‚Äôm really starting to like the use of the Georgia font as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Guess He Heard the Footsteps!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;New services around the country are reporting that good ol‚Äô Tom ‚ÄúThe Hammer‚Äù DeLay is stepping down from his bid to run again for Congress.  Couldn‚Äôt be better news to me.  I just wonder why it‚Äôs taken so long.  Perhaps he got advanced warning of the extent of Tom Rudy‚Äôs cooperation, and pending charges that will be harder to shake.&lt;br /&gt;
I also wonder if those who donated to his re-election can ask for a refund, and how the successor is chosen.  A run off between the remaining 3 candidates?
I also wonder if Bush and the Rove machine will continue to stand by their man, or will attempt to distance themselves and the White House from DeLay.
I‚Äôm sure some answers will come sooner than later, but that‚Äôs at least one perpetrator of the culture of corruption that won‚Äôt be influencing the laws of our country, and won‚Äôt be perpetuating the good ol‚Äô boy network on Capitol Hill come this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tom, Can You Hear the Footsteps?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://go.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=politicsNews&amp;amp;storyID=11689353&amp;amp;src=rss/ElectionCoverage&quot;&gt; Reuters.com&lt;/a&gt;
In case you‚Äôve been asleep the last 4 days, Abramhoff got 5 years 10 months for his role in the Sun Cruz line purchase.  Still to come are sentences for his multitude of other indiscretions while a lobbyist.  Though that sentence is bound to be lessened based on his cooperation with prosecutors, and run concurrent to these charges.  I really hope these prosecutors are holding out for DeLay, and not just Ney.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More Smoke and Mirrors from Bush's Environmental Policies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/washington/31wetlands.html?ex=1301461200&amp;amp;en=ef83589618f8fd98&amp;amp;ei=5088&amp;amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;Fewer Marshes + More Man-made Ponds = Increased Wetlands - New York Times&lt;/a&gt;
I‚Äôd really like to meet the genius who came up with this idea.  ‚ÄúHey, we can turn a negative into a positive if we simply start counting any puddle as wetlands.  Heck, the golf course that surrounds my new house must have at least 15 ponds, let‚Äôs start counting those‚Ä¶ah screw the pesticides and fertilizers that filter into the ponds‚Ä¶‚Äù.
As a Florida native, it breaks my heart every time I take a drive through an area that once used to be ‚Äúswampy‚Äù, and now is condo, or subdivision.  I do enjoy playing golf, but would never trade a cypress swamp for a course.  And nor do I think my goverment should either.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free Long Distance and Double the Internet Speed for Half the Cost?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sign me up.  Got the call from the local cable company, Brighthouse tonight saying that with our current package, I can add VOIP telephone and and twice as much download rates for Road Runner for basically half of what I pay monthly for my traditional phone service.  And they claim they have battery backup for phone service in case of power outage (we keep an old fashioned phone around for those just in case moments, though a cell phone now makes it less used).  How can you beat that.  And one less bill a month to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;
So if anyone has any experience with the digital phone service, I‚Äôve still got two weeks before they come to install, I‚Äôd really love some feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jan Schneider for Congress FL-13 in 2006</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.votejan.com/&quot;&gt;Jan Schneider for Congress&lt;/a&gt;Just a note to any readers in  Congressional district 13, to support Jan Schneider in her attempt to take the seat vacated by Katherine Harris.  I‚Äôve gotten several emails pushing for her support, and come across a couple of blog posts as well, so I took a minute to check out her credentials.  Not your soccer mom got bored, or super rich white girl with nothing better to do type of candidate.  It‚Äôs also my understanding that a recent Democrat convert is being supported by the DNC.  I hope that‚Äôs not the case, and all because one may have a few more dollars than the other.  Shame shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd love to know more about this one, so if you have any details, do share.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy (Belated) Anniversary to Me!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, just over a year ago I started blogging.  I believe I‚Äôve grown quite a bit in my web knowledge in a short time of actually using a site I‚Äôve started.  I tried doing something with just about every free resource out there, it just never ‚Äútook‚Äù.  It wasn‚Äôt until my friend over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinylittledots.com&quot;&gt;tiny little dots&lt;/a&gt; adopted WordPress, and thus I installed it on my newly purchased domain, did the light go on.  At once I felt at home.  I immediately begin cramming massive amounts of CSS knowledge into my already crowded head. I now can I say I can see myself actually putting food on the table and a roof over my head some day doing this stuff full time.  I‚Äôve got a long way to go, and need to particularly see where I ‚Äúfit in‚Äù, but it is quite exciting, a feeling I lost quite some time ago in regards to cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a hardy thank you to tiny for adopting WP and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.7milesdown.com/wp/&quot;&gt;trench&lt;/a&gt; for my first blogroll link.  Also a big thanks to the many people who‚Äôve stopped by and left a comment, it‚Äôs always nice to know someones reading the site :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing what the next year of doing this brings, what direction things will go, but if the first was any indication, it‚Äôs going to be great.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Favorite Mac freeware</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A last minute entry into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www,freemacware.com&quot;&gt;freemacware.com‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; contest, listing your 5 most favored freeware apps.  Their list is quite extensive, and I‚Äôve found several apps I didn‚Äôt know about, but for the most part, these are the ones I use day in and day out. (I can‚Äôt say these are in any particular order)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacware.com/cyberduck&quot;&gt;Cyberduck&lt;/a&gt; - a super great FTP client, that works hand in hand with several text editors and CSS Edit to allow editing files directly on the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacware.com/smultron&quot;&gt;Smultron&lt;/a&gt; - my text editor of choice.  As noted, it works flawlessly with Cyberduck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacware.com/growl&quot;&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt; - A sytem wide notification app, that works with numerous apps, including cyberduck to notify you when a file's been up/down loaded, in itunes when a new song plays, can set up a gmail or mail notifier, and numerous other apps all with an unobtrusive faded in box in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacware.com/adium&quot;&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt; - my IM app of choice.  I don't do IM with a lot of different people, however, I do a lot of work with people all of the world, so having AOL, yahoo and gtalk all in the same app makes it quite easy to connect with a client in their IM of choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacware.com/voodoopad-lite&quot;&gt;VooDoo Pad lite&lt;/a&gt; - A fantastic note app, that works like a little wiki right on your desktop.  I really love how I can make a table of contents type page, and then create &quot;links&quot; to new pages.  I can really simply, and quickly organize a project this way.  Also supports drag and drop functionality too, so I can drag an image to a page, a link generally anything.  I've seriously thought about purchasing the &quot;pro&quot; version, or what ever they call it, simply because I use the app so much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other apps I use/recommend are obviously &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacware.com/firefox&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt;, as well as&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacware.com/vienna&quot;&gt; vienna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacware.com/flickrexport&quot;&gt;flickr export&lt;/a&gt; an iphoto plugin that allows quick and easy sharing of your photos via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I‚Äôve missed a great app, I‚Äôd love to know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Huh?  Just Like Linux?</title>

This one‚Äôs been slashed, furled, delicioused, and what ever else is the social bookmarking flavor of the day, but WTF?  Comparing this to the development of Linux?  They are unimportant, but important?  I‚Äôm just shaking my head at this.  Anyone explain to me the significance?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Landzilla- From the Swamp WordPress Theme Updated</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a client who chose the Landzilla theme, but wanted some color changes.  While in the process of doing that, I found the theme used a single index file, with no seperate header, sidebar, footer, etc.  So I‚Äôve repackaged the theme with the new colors, a  few other changes, as well as a .psd file to insert your own 181 x121 pixel images into the four boxes in the header graphic.
A screenshot can be seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/images/From_the_Swamp_screenshot.jpg&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/Landzilla-From_the_Swamp.zip&quot;&gt;download.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any questions, just leave a comment, I‚Äôll try to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, the name, well, Florida is really just one big swamp‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pimping Emusic Again</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just can‚Äôt say enough about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emusic.com&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, and have been that way for the 5 on and off years I‚Äôve been using it.  I‚Äôve downloaded everything from Charlie Parker to the Cows.  Some of the recent stuff I‚Äôve downloaded includes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emusic.com/artist/11573/11573581.html&quot;&gt;Tres Chicas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emusic.com/artist/11506/11506025.html&quot;&gt;Minus the Bear&lt;/a&gt;, and some old stuff including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emusic.com/artist/11625/11625629.html&quot;&gt;fIREHOSE‚Äôs &lt;/a&gt; if‚Äôn.
So if you are interested in a free trial -50 downloads (will require credit card, but won‚Äôt be charged unless you don‚Äôt cancel after month), and want to help me get some free downloads (if you like the service and keep it after the month trial, I get 50 downloads myself), leave a comment or use my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/contact&quot;&gt;Contact Page&lt;/a&gt;.  I‚Äôll send you the special link that will help me get the hook up too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Typeface and the Web</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An interesting&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beadesigngroup.com/blog/archives/2006/03/five_steps_to_font_freedom.html&quot;&gt;post and comments&lt;/a&gt; regarding type face and web design.  While I struggle to learn the basics, and don‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; notice the difference in types, I continue to read on the subject, and found a useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://typetester.maratz.com/&quot;&gt;on-line tool&lt;/a&gt; to compare fonts, and the many other options that CSS allows in setting typography.  I really am trying to approach my learning of web design from a usability aspect, vs a pure aesthetic one, which typsetting can have a huge effect on.  Still a long road, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A New Desktop Computer For Miklb</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I‚Äôve been toiling away for years now with outdated G3 macs, and kept hemming and hawing, waiting for the ‚Äúnext wave‚Äù of new Macs.  Well, I couldn‚Äôt take it any longer, and broke down and grabbed one of the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macmini/&quot;&gt;dual-core Mac Minis&lt;/a&gt; as I had a 17‚Äù VGA monitor for the window‚Äôs box, as well as existing USB keyboard and mouse from the old imac.  So it‚Äôs up and running, albeit I need to find someone locally who can install 3rd party ram, as I‚Äôm not paying Apple $300 for a gig stick of ram so than can install it for free.  Maybe Comp-USA?  Anyway, one thing that I noticed right off the bat was FireFox was not liking running on Rosetta, the built in conversion for older apps to the new intel processor.  So I was all but switching back to Safari, as FF was just choking.  That is, until today, when I found an ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mac:Intel&quot;&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; of the soon to be released universal binary of FF.  Sweet.  All of my extensions work with ‚ÄúDeerPark‚Äù, and things load as fast as they should be, no hang ups. (so far).  I‚Äôm really loving the move to Tiger as well, not to mention the shear fact of having a processor and HD meant for this century :).  I haven‚Äôt really had to time to play with any of the iLife apps, or use Front Row, but all in due time.
No to start saving for when the new 17‚Äù macbook pros come out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hosting My Own RSS aggregator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started using RSS, I choose &lt;a href=&quot;http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire Lite&lt;/a&gt; and was quite pleased with the functionality.  I then discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html&quot;&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; an open source, free, aggregator.  Which  I liked a little better than  NetNewsWire.  I then went on my merry way adding and subtracting feeds, and keeping up with multiple sites with no problems.  Then I got my new desktop computer, all snazzy with OS Tiger, and have begun using it much, much, more than I ever did the old one.  Thus a dilemma began, how to keep track of what has been read and what hasn‚Äôt when switching from desktop to laptop.  Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://gregarius.net/&quot;&gt;Gregarious&lt;/a&gt;.  I can host it on my server, and access it from both machines, and, voil√° , no need to use a desktop aggregator, no need to deal with someone elses hosted aggregator, and ads, I‚Äôm sure.  It was quite easy to install (though I did have to manually import the sql database info), and easily imported my opml file from vienna, so all my feeds were picked up, and I never lossed a beat.  You can take a look at my feeds at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/rss&quot;&gt;Miklb‚Äôs Feeds&lt;/a&gt;.  Right now it‚Äôs the vanilla default install, but I intend to give it some customization (like I have free time right now‚Ä¶)
So, take a look, maybe you‚Äôll find a feed worth adding to your reader of choice, or maybe you‚Äôll decide to give Gregarius a shot yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

Please, if you live in the Houston area, go out and vote against DeLay tomorrow.  You don‚Äôt have to be a Republican to vote, so what better way for Democrats and independents to send Congress and the Bush White House a message than to vote out their man in a primary?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sure Harris Was on the Up and Up in 2000</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sptimes.com/2006/03/02/State/New_questions_dog_the.shtml&quot;&gt;State: New questions dog the Harris campaign&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; src=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/images/harris.gif&quot; alt=&quot;harris&quot; /&gt;The argument has been made over and over to defend the clown woman for her actions in handling the Election in 2000, and the events leading up to it (see Texas company hired to purge thousands of ‚Äúfelons‚Äù from voter roll, etc).  Now she‚Äôs seen clearly in bed with an admitted criminal who‚Äôs been found to illegally donate to her campaign, she‚Äôs been documented to have worked with/campaigned with/for ol‚Äô Duke Cunningham, who‚Äôs admitted to taking kick backs/bribes.  If it looks like a circus clown, and talks like a circus clown‚Ä¶nah, that‚Äôs not fair to the memory of Emmitt Kelly.
My only worry is that she won‚Äôt run this fall, and Bill Nelson will actually have to campaign against someone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>And I Thought I Had a Bad Night</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As much as I love food, and cooking, and know that real restaurants are out there with caring owners and concerned staff, the combination of my hard-headedness and bad luck, I‚Äôve not worked in one in a long time.  I loathe working in a restaurant right now, and pray for the day that I discover that I really can make a living working with the web, or some other career opens up, but until then, I‚Äôm in it.
And with that off my chest, I really had a bad night, and was looking forward to getting home, and watching my favorite hockey team take on their in-state rival. (yeah, another sports post, go figure).  So I settle in on the couch with some munchies and fire up the DVR, and no sooner than the game starts, it was over.  And it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tbo.com/sports/lightning/MGBDTF869KE.html&quot;&gt;downhill from there.&lt;/a&gt;  So thanks Lightning for reminding me that I might not have been the only one who had a bad day, and that you‚Äôve got to put it behind you, learn what you can from your mistakes, and accept the fact that somedays, it‚Äôs just not your day.  Here‚Äôs to a better tomorrow, and a run for the Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anyone Up for some Fantasy Baseball?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven‚Äôt blogged about it before, but I‚Äôm a huge sports fan, baseball, football, and hockey, in no particular order, just depends on the season.  I‚Äôm quite the homer, and have been a life long Buccaneers fan, as well as followed the Devil Rays since day one.  It took a few years of the Lightning being in town, but I proudly say I was at their first playoff game in St. Petersburg, so I‚Äôve been a fan for long enough not to be called a band wagon fan.  I follow the sports in general as well, and since first going on line, have participated in one form or another of fantasy sports.  For me, its a  way of keeping up with the rest of the league, and gives you some one to root for when watching games other than the home team.
So, that said, I‚Äôm looking for other bloggers to play in a free online fantasy league via cbs.sportsline. &lt;!--more--&gt; It‚Äôs only for bragging rights, but can be a fun way to get to know others online, as well as add &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; online distraction.  I‚Äôm only doing one league, so if this one doesn‚Äôt pan out, I‚Äôll jump into something else, but I‚Äôm hopping to find at least 9 others to participate.  I‚Äôm planning on doing a straight rotisserie league, meaning you draft a hitter for each position, several outfielders ,and a pitching staff.  Then based on their stats in each category, they are ranked 1-x x being the number of players.  So if you have a guy leading the league in HR, he‚Äôll have the most points.  Likewise with pitchers and KO, ERA, Saves, wins, WHIP (walks+hits per inning pitched, you want a low number here, same with ERA).  So leave a comment &lt;strong&gt;and the link to your blog&lt;/strong&gt; along with the required email in the comments and I‚Äôll send a link, league name and password.  Basically the first 11 bloggers to comment and register are in, draft will be live, but if you can‚Äôt make it, you can rank your players and you‚Äôll auto draft.  Not as fun, but I‚Äôve seen people win leagues with a computer drafted team.  I‚Äôll decide on draft time when I find out where on the planet all the players are, and try and find a common time to do it.  Like I said, nothing but bragging rights, and I‚Äôll probably knock out a button for the winner to flaunt their baseball superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scooter Libby, Global Crime Fighter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/22/AR2006022202251.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; Can someone tell me why the Chief of Staff was ‚Äúso preoccupied with national security issues‚Äù?  They make it sound like he was personally out hunting Bin Laden himself.  Maybe he was, and he and Cheney took shooting lessons together, as neither hit their intended target.  I have a feeling nothing will ever come of any of this, and that the Republicans are going to successfully sweep ALL of this under the rug, until , oh 10 years from now, when someone‚Äôs broke and needs a tell all book.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog Designs, Function or Form?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This started out as a simple comment on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cre8d-design.com/blog/2006/02/22/blog-layouts-boring/&quot;&gt;Rachel‚Äôs design blog&lt;/a&gt;, but started getting wordy, so I converted it to a post w/trackback. (Which may be a thought for a future post, what is too long of a comment?)
The part I found myself relating to was the design of Squible, and user experience, which I found myself having recently gone through.
 I had gotten busy, neglected my blogging, and when I got back into the swing of things,felt a new look was in order.  Not having that much time, I opted for Squible.  A good friend who also blogs noted that he ‚Äújust couldn‚Äôt get his head around that format‚Äù.  I fought changing things back for some time, but that comment hung around in the back of my head.  I kept thinking that this guy is a ‚Äúweb guy, a designer.  If he can‚Äôt get around it, what about the other 150+ a day that stumble upon place.‚Äù  So when I changed hosts, and upgraded, I tried Squible for all of about 20 minutes, and then cobbled together a more traditional blog design.&lt;br /&gt;
Not that as a fledgling, wanna-be designer I don‚Äôt want to push my envelope, but I have to come back to the user experience.  Much as my cooking evolved from wanting to be ‚Äúeverychef‚Äù, that is, I wanted to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlietrotters.com/index.asp&quot;&gt;Charlie Trotter&lt;/a&gt;, Jean Louis Paladin, &lt;a href=&quot;www.chefallen.com/home.cfm&quot;&gt;Alan Susser&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jean-georges.com/main.html&quot;&gt;Jean Georges Vongrichten&lt;/a&gt; on every plate.  Little by little, I learned that my guests weren‚Äôt looking for me to defy gravity and mix flavors that might not otherwise be mixed, simply for the sake of ‚Äúpushing the envelope‚Äù.  It took me a long time to understand that my guests wanted a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; meal.  Sure, an unexpected flavor that contrasts but doesn‚Äôt detract, or a creative yet accessible presentation is fine, but make it edible.  But I digress.
I still want to push envelopes, and broaden horizons, and all those clich√©s, but first and formost, I want the ramblings, and info to be accessible, and to flow in some manner that people will ‚Äúget‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&quot;VOTE LEAVES COULTER DANGLING LIKE A CHAD&quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.palmbeachpost.com/celebrities/content/local_news/epaper/2006/02/19/a2a_jose_0219.html&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;gt;Palm Beach Post (second story)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I first read about this, I thought it was much ado about nothing, a simple oversight by a transplant who registered to vote without a permanent address, blah blah, benefit of the doubt.
  Now the truth comes out that she was simply a lazy bitch who didn‚Äôt feel she needed to follow the rules.  Which is how the story originally broke.  All she had to do was fill out the change of address form, and be done with it, but no, the woman who recently used the term ‚Äúraghead‚Äù in reference to Arabs in a post 9.11 world, walked out of the voting precint she should have voted in, and drove to the one she originally registered in and voted.  Which, is clearly defined in FL law, as a 3rd degree felony. What I would give to see her charged.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trying Out CoComments</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cocomment.com/&quot;&gt;CoComments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is open to anyone, though they have a caveat that if server load gets too high, they‚Äôll shut down registration again.  I hadn‚Äôt really paid attention to it, though I‚Äôve seen it mentioned, but the concept is sound.  How often do you leave comments on a blog, and then forget where, and wonder if there was a follow up?  Happens to me all the time.  I keep tabs on several RSS feeds that a general in nature, and will drop a comment on a strangers blog often, only to fade from my memory.  Not anymore, if CoComments works as advertised.  You are given a simple bookmarklet to use before you formally submit a comment.  You then can keep track of the comments via their site, or better yet, your RSS feed.  In addition, you‚Äôll see a box in my sidebar, so visitors can see where I‚Äôm visiting and commenting.  Another way of building community, in my oh, so humble opinion.  Though, I‚Äôve yet to see it in action, I‚Äôve seen it on another‚Äôs blog.  And I doubt it will take long before I put it in action.  So go register if interested, ‚Äòcause it could be like Google Analytics, and close with no notice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSS Reboot Spring '06</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I cobbled this design out of something else I was working on, to break out of the constraints of using someone else‚Äôs work, but intend on something extrordinary for the site, especially the oft-not  used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com&quot;&gt;entry page&lt;/a&gt;.  So I signed up for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cssreboot.com/&quot;&gt;CSS Reboot&lt;/a&gt; as a means of having a tangible goal, as well as some pressure to knock one out of the park.  So things won‚Äôt change much around here until May, but check back then for a whole new miklb.com.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Attempts at Gulf Drilling</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://go.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=politicsNews&amp;amp;storyID=11243736&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New attempts at opening up the gulf to gas and oil drilling, this under the assumption that the current methods are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.  And that no accidents happened last year during the hurricanes.  Whippee.  Thankfully, even Mel Martinez is saying he will oppose the legislation, as well as most of the congressional delegation from Florida.  If they would only draft legislation taking the area off the table for X number of years, so we didn‚Äôt have to hear about this every year.  If you haven‚Äôt yet, be sure you‚Äôve contacted your Senator and Congressman about this, or any issue you feel strongly about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tampa Politics Strikes Again</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;(warning- long rant)
&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; src=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/images/tampa01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tampa&quot; /&gt;
While I was loosing my mind week before last, so was Tampa‚Äôs city council.  The difference is, I‚Äôve &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; come to grips with how I did, and how to prevent it, unfortunately, this council hasn‚Äôt.  To be fair, two, Dingfelder and Saul-Sena, were opposed and clear thinking in how to handle the situation I‚Äôm referring to.
For those not familiar with Tampa, it‚Äôs a fairly ‚Äúyoung‚Äùcity, not really getting into the swing of things until the late 1880‚Äôs, and didn‚Äôt really hit it‚Äôs stride until just after the turn of the century.  Which just happens to coincide with the boom of the cigar industry.  Hence the nickname that still lingers for Tampa, ‚ÄúCigar City‚Äù. &lt;!--more--&gt;
Fast forward to 2005.  The city‚Äôs historic preservation council came to a consensus that there are 15 remaining factories that should be designated as historic buildings to maintain the heritage and fabric of the city.  Sounds logical, no?  Several of the buildings are boarded up, in some level of disrepair.  Others are in use for some type of business, but aren‚Äôt necessarily in prime condition, while a scant few, from my understanding, have been rehabilitated, with every effort to maintain the historic nature of the building.
So, trying to make a long story short, (I watch probably 60% of the city council meetings, so I‚Äôve caught most of the discussion) 5 of the factories decided they didn‚Äôt want to be a historic building, and are crying ‚Äúproperty rights‚Äù.  Boo Hoo.  They knew what they were buying when they did.  It‚Äôs not like they bought some building, and only after tearing off a more modern facade found they had the original five and dime in an old part of town.  It‚Äôs a bloody 4 story brick building with the words ‚Äúcigar factory‚Äù painted on the side.
So anyway, after much deliberation, and arguing, and posturing, the council majority decides these property owners should have the option to not be designated.  That all property owners should have that option.  Hmm.&lt;br /&gt;
‚ÄúYou own the oldest building in town, it‚Äôs historic, we are going to designate it.‚Äù
‚Äú No I don‚Äôt.  I say no.‚Äù
‚ÄúOk.‚Äù
Makes sense to me.  Not.
The kicker is, there is already an option to file for economic hardship, and &lt;strong&gt;prove&lt;/strong&gt; that the designation would bring undue financial burdens on you.  But these owners didn‚Äôt even want to bother.  They simply wanted to strong arm the council into letting them have their way.  The overall community voice at the meetings were in favor of a blanket designation.  But because most of these council members are running for office outside the city council, they don‚Äôt want to be painted as ‚Äúdo-gooders‚Äù I guess, and alienate the developers that will float their campaign for county seats.  So, despite the advice of their lawyer, and testimony of countless citizens and historic preservation experts, they‚Äôve sent the item back to the legal department to draft a ordinance giving property owners the right  to decide whether or not their building is historic or not.  Hopefully, this will be pushed further than the 6 months they‚Äôve set it aside, and a more sensible group of council members will realize that the historic nature of these buildings, and the fabric of the communities these buildings reside in, depend on their designation, and that the existing laws are sufficient to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù the owner.  &lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/images/tampa02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tampa&quot; /&gt;
For those in Tampa, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Council/&quot;&gt;contact your council&lt;/a&gt; and tell them how much these buildings mean to the city.  This is not an eminent domain issue.  Nobody is taking the buildings away, we simply want to make sure that they are preserved in a matter than maintains the historic nature and keeps the craftsmanship and integrity of the building intact.
Even if you are not in Tampa, but respect the historic nature of such landmarks, feel free to contact them and express how historic buildings in your city are important.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Moving Day</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, then the dns have populated, and you are viewing the site on the new server.  My hosting was about to be up, not to mention I was having trouble with the old host, in the sense they didn‚Äôt seem to care if I renewed, especially in regards to the manner they handled the last two tickets I opened.  I understand things happen, but don‚Äôt treat me like a child or idiot.&lt;br /&gt;
More about the new hosting later, anyway, pardon the dust, and the half done look.  I need to get the rest of the site back up, meaning the cooking and my sandbox.  After that, some TLC to the home office. I did manage to finally update to 2.0, and the only problem so far seems to be a conflict with an RSS plugin and the built in magpie RSS for Squible (which might get the door, we‚Äôll see).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; I just couldn‚Äôt take Squible anymore.  It‚Äôs a great theme, and there are aspects I do like, it‚Äôs just not me.  So I‚Äôm adapting a design I‚Äôve been working on for something else for the time being, and will continue to tweak over the next few days.  I hope it doesn‚Äôt interupt anyone‚Äôs viewing of the more popular posts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Al Franken Sets the Record Straight</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-franken/reflections-on-the-wellst_b_15459.html?&quot;&gt;Al Franken over at HuffPo&lt;/a&gt; sets the record straight regarding the Wellstone Memorial, especially in comparison to the King Service.  A point he touches on, that the conservative pundits have failed to, regarding Carter‚Äôs comments, is that Carter knew Coretta Scott King.  Recently, while watching Carter on Larry King, he remarked that he probably wouldn‚Äôt have been president had it not been for King.  He said she campaigned strongly for him in ‚Äò76.  It just burns the Republicans that he‚Äôs still out there in the world, making things happen, and they‚Äôre busy putting out Abramhoff and Libby fires.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Proverbial Fox Guarding the Hen House</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060208/ap_on_go_co/delay_appropriations;_ylt=AkPc7IcFEINjwxZdiLuRqfqs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3OXIzMDMzBHNlYwM3MDM-&quot;&gt;AP (via Yahoo)&lt;/a&gt;  So, the old Hammer slips in shit and comes out smelling like a rose.  He‚Äôs been handed a ‚Äúcoveted‚Äù seat on the Appropriations Committee, and get this, a seat on the sub-committee overseeing the Justice Department.  Which, just so happens to be who is investigating the Abramhoff scandal.  And while he‚Äôs at it, he got a seat overseeing NASA (the same NASA that was recently revealed to have a political appointee of Bush‚Äôs who‚Äôs been censoring its scientists on global warming, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scientificactivist.blogspot.com/2006/02/breaking-news-george-deutsch-did-not.html&quot;&gt;doesn‚Äôt have a completed college degree&lt;/a&gt; and regardless of his studies, his major was journalism).  Anyway, back to DeLay, go figure, he‚Äôs up for reelection, and now sits on the NASA subcommittee, and guess what, his home district just happens to be Houston, home of Johnson Space Center.  So anyone with half a brain can tell you that was as politically motivated an appointment as they get, and despite what anyone says, the Republicans are going about dirty business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Internet Explorer 7: Beta 2 Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/default.mspx&quot;&gt;Internet Explorer 7: Beta 2 Preview&lt;/a&gt;I never thought I‚Äôd herald the release of an IE product, and after testing it I may not be so interested, but if you‚Äôve ever sat up until 5am trying to hack IE bugs in a completely valid site while your client in California keeps saying, ‚ÄúIn IE‚Ä¶‚Äù, then the prospects of some of those bugs being gone is well, worth the annoucement.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/29/445242.aspx&quot;&gt;Annouced last July on the developer‚Äôs blog&lt;/a&gt;, these bugs are supposed to be addressed  in beta 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Peekaboo bug&lt;/li&gt;
    	&lt;li&gt;Guillotine bug&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Duplicate Character bug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Border Chaos&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No Scroll bug&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; 3 Pixel Text Jog&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Magic Creeping Text bug&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Bottom Margin bug on Hover&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Losing the ability to highlight text under the top border&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; IE/Win Line-height bug&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Double Float Margin Bug&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Quirky Percentages in IE&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Duplicate indent&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Moving viewport scrollbar outside HTML borders&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; 1 px border style&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Disappearing List-background&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fix width:auto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I‚Äôll say a bug I spent several hours hacking last night is fixed in beta2.  Good sign (it was a lesser known a:hover background sticking bug, for those who care).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, maybe a little less cursing now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why I Love Spam Karma...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶and will be hitting Dr Dave‚Äôs PayPal later today.  The last couple of days, I had noticed I was getting S P A M emails, that &lt;em&gt;seemed&lt;/em&gt; legit.  But further investigation, revealed that it was bunk.  First giveaway  was the ‚ÄúGreat Site‚Äù, but the kicker would be a fishing site commenting on a fishing article.  They are searching technorait, or google blog search, and finding keywords and then hitting.  So, some what frustrated, I delete, and wonder if &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/&quot;&gt;Bad Behavior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/&quot;&gt;Spam Karma&lt;/a&gt; are working.  Low and behold I go to delete some more via SK, and I‚Äôm greeted by a message saying it‚Äôs not just me with spam getting through, and offering up some solutions, with an assurance that there are more tricks to SK to squash the recent wave of Spammers if it persists.  Well worth a trip to Dr. Dave‚Äôs site and donate what ever you can, be it a month‚Äôs intake of Google Ads, or $10, or more, if you can spare it.  I‚Äôve already done so with Bad Behavior, and so should you, especially if you spend any where the time I‚Äôve spent the last two days cleaning 3 blogs of spam.  The donation is well worth the time it would save.&lt;/p&gt;

So a week before Bush rolls out his new budget, Congress gets to ‚Äúplay‚Äù with the the 9 billion dollar a year Star Wars missle defense project that has yet to work.  I‚Äôm guessing this is the whole reason DeLay was really trying to keep his job.  Meanwhile, cuts to federal student loans, medicare, and many other needed social programs keep getting slashed to the bone.  What was the budget deficit again?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Another Shameless Plug &amp; Catching UP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I‚Äôve been busy giving my often neglected &lt;a href=&quot;http://cookingwith.miklb.com&quot;&gt;cooking site&lt;/a&gt; a much needed face lift, which at least I‚Äôve been telling myself was what I needed to start posting more over there.  Lord knows I need to connect to food again.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I‚Äôm basically paralyzed by the utter lack of coverage by the ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù media.  Seems the conservative powers that be have chiseled away at the ‚Äúleft leaning‚Äù place like CNN, where the recent announcements of Bill Bennett and, what‚Äôs his name, Glen Beck, have all but proven that the CNN is fighting to be the next FOX.
Look for a new look here at Mindless Ramblings next, with an emphasis on bringing in more content, and maybe slightly more emphasis on sharing the web design articles I find around the net.  Not to say I don‚Äôt need to get back on the hammer trail.  I‚Äôd also like to focus on Florida politics a little more, with the upcoming elections having great importance to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can Someone Please tell Sessions to STFU?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching the Alito Confirmation Hearing on CSPAN, and now the second time I‚Äôve listened to Jeff Sessions of Alabama blubber over Alito.  Who voted him head cheerleader?  Is he not intelligent enough to fake the tough questions, or too stupid to lob the easy ones for Alito to hit out of the park?  I mean, I‚Äôm not impressed with the some of the lines of questioning I‚Äôve seen from the Democrats either, but this bafoon takes the bloody cake.  If these 16 some odd folks are the best this country can muster, we are worse shape than I thought‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; OK, now Graham is trying to compare Alito‚Äôs confirmation hearing to crooked Republicans who have taken money from Abramhoff.  WTF??&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Letter to Apple Support (kottke.org)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kottke.org/06/01/letter-to-apple-support&quot;&gt;Letter to Apple Support (kottke.org)&lt;/a&gt;
How often did I hear this lament during the short time I worked at Apple.  ‚ÄúI just bought my iPod 5 weeks ago‚Ä¶Why didn‚Äôt you tell me that a new powerbook would be out 2 weeks after Christmas..‚Äù  All of which you couldn‚Äôt tell customers, even though you were reading the rumor sites, and &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; an update of some kind would be  forthcoming, but company rules forbade you from discussing that with customers, because, after all, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just rumors‚Äù.  Occassionally, Apple will allow for a return if it‚Äôs within a time frame, and the customer can then pay the difference of the new product and the old.
But regarding Kottke‚Äôs dilemma, the macbook pro is taking orders starting today, but the question is when will it ship.  He, like many others who found a powerbook on the shelf, or got one shipped, probably knew the intel laptops were on the horizon, whether or not they were going to be a ‚Äúpro‚Äù level release first may not have been leaked, but by summer, most thought.  Which is when I‚Äôm guessing most who don‚Äôt order this week will get their hands on the new machine anyway.  So as I said, the question is, did they need the machine before, say, April? Or could they have squeaked out 6 more months  to see what happens.  And though I‚Äôm a firm believer in Apple‚Äôs products, I‚Äôm not unfamiliar with the chances that a bad egg can come down the pipe at anytime, and those who purchase the the macbook pro will be bitching they wished they had bought a G4 powerbook.  So it‚Äôs a gamble, and Apple‚Äôs been fairly straightfoward with running out new machines or updates every 6 months.  So chances are, by June there will be a macbook home with similar specs as today‚Äôs announcement, for $600 less.  And on a side note, I‚Äôm guessing someone of Jason Kottke‚Äôs stature &lt;em&gt;just might get their exchange&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if not, Jason, we can talk when you‚Äôre ready to sell that g4 used‚Ä¶.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hammer on the Shelf</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://houstonchronicle.com/disp/story.mpl/front/3572030.html&quot;&gt;Chron.com &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that he‚Äôs made more mainstream news cycles, I‚Äôve refrained from posting much on the Hammer.  But I feel this news is worthy of a shout from the cliff, as it signals to me the pressure from within the party is doing exactly what I said they would do‚Ä¶use him up and throw him on hte scrap heap.  He will probably lose his primary in March, as I‚Äôd guess the republican machine will throw their money behind his competitor, hoping he‚Äôll have a better chance against a democrat in the fall.  From there, he can be a fall guy for the Abramhoff deal, along with Ney, probably taking a bullet or two for several other republicans.  So this story is FAR from over, and the dominos have yet to get primary players, but one can only hope the truth &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

Hmmm.  Interesting rant.  Also curious as to why the author is using XHTML, &lt;em&gt;transitional&lt;/em&gt;  Note, this site &lt;em&gt;used to&lt;/em&gt;be valid, but as a user of the Alpha Squible theme, it currently isn‚Äôt.  That will change with either a switch to the impending beta, or a totally new design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ANWR Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Incase you missed it, Democrats and two Republicans, Mike DeWine and Lincoln Chafee, stood their ground, and managed to keep ANWR off the defense bill.  Pete Dominenici of New Mexico (?) has already vowed to add it to a filibuster proof budget bill in the spring, one I‚Äôm sure that will be full of all kinds of pork barrel projects.  So warm up that keyboard and start writing your represenatives, and voice your opinion, be it on ANWR, or the President spying on fellow Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arctic drilling on a defense bill.  If you‚Äôve read here lately, you know my stance on that.  And now even some Republicans are calling Stevens and Frist out on playing politics with our national defense.  And poor ol‚Äô Dick might have to cut his trip short to cast a vote.  Let‚Äôs hope that doesn‚Äôt happen, or he gets held up by a sandstorm.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The &quot;Response&quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you for contacting me regarding the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). I appreciate hearing from you and would like to respond to your concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding new sources of domestic energy is critical to our national security. Today, our nation is 58 percent dependent on sources of energy from the Western Hemisphere, including 14 percent from Venezuela. Judging by recent political developments, Venezuela is not a stable or reliable source of oil for our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo Chavez has actively been seeking new markets, such as China, for Venezuela?s oil, which would leave us struggling to replace a sizable percentage of our country?s needs with most likely very little warning. With today?s soaring oil and gasoline prices, we need to be forward thinking about world events and their effect on our oil supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to think globally about environmental issues. Drilling in ANWR using the most advanced technology and strictest environmental regulations will keep environmental impact to a minimum. Drilling technologies such as multi-lateral drills and directional drilling are just two examples of ways we are now able to minimize environmental impact. Other countries are not necessarily following the same strict environmental standards used in the U.S., and this puts us in the position of exporting our own environmental concerns to countries with much looser environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drilling in ANWR - in a part of Alaska that was set aside by the Eisenhower administration in 1960 for oil and gas exploration, with overwhelming support from its population and congressional delegation, and under some of the strictest environmental standards in the world ? is a sound and balanced approach that will help alleviate our dependence on foreign sources of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANWR is a huge area encompassing over 19 million acres. The environmental footprint of oil and gas operations will be limited to 2,000 acres, which is roughly the size of Dulles International Airport in Virginia. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, ANWR is estimated to contain resources ranging from 7.7 billion to 10.9 billion barrels of recoverable oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we address the need for development of domestic sources of energy, Florida?s moratorium on offshore drilling will remain firmly in place as one of my highest priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. If you have any additional questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my follow up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I appreciate your quick response, and though your explanation seems reasonable, you have not explained how your arguments to support drilling in ANWR can not be then used against you to drill off the coast of Florida.  I know the military is expressing the need for the Eastern Gulf for maneuvers, however outside that reason what are your defenses for not supporting exploration and drilling off our coasts?  I must also express my doubts in the &quot;strict&quot; regulations you defend your choice with.  From my perspective, this administration has loosened regulations from the day it took office, and I have severe doubts that this would be any different.  And finally, could you explain how 8-11 billion gallons of oil justifies the potential risks and damage.  At what expense is a years worth of oil?  And when do we draw the line?  How will you argue that 4 months worth of natural gas isn't worth rigs off our beaches? 
And finally Senator Martinez, how do you justify playing politics with a budget bill aimed for the military and potentially the lives of our countrymen and women?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Can't Wait to See How Mel Answers that Letter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I wrote my Senators late last week voicing my concerns over the fact that the slime ball Republicans were tagging things like ANWR drilling on a defense dept budget.  We‚Äôve got fellow Americans with their lives on the line over seas, and their safety depends on the allocation of funds to the military.  And so what are scum bags like Ted Stevens doing? Playing politics with those fellow countryman‚Äôs lives.  Yep.  Betting their constituents lives that Democrats won‚Äôt vote against a DoD bill.  I‚Äôm sure Senator Nelson will be at the forefront of maneuvers to separate the two, but I‚Äôm not so sure Martinez will be.  I told him in my email that not only did I think it was disgusting to play politics with soldiers lives, I also said that supporting drilling in ANWR would be to support drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.  His site says all correspondence will receive a written response, so I can‚Äôt wait to hear how he justifies this one.  Perhaps you may want to contact your representatives and see how they can justify their actions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Could This Be Rumsfeld's Last Stand</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/14/AR2005121400774.html&quot;&gt;House Panel Subpoenas Rumsfeld on Katrina&lt;/a&gt;  Rumors have flown for weeks, months, hell, years, that Rumsfeld was on his way out.  News reports have surfaced that the Bush administration, in attempts to woo moderate Dems, was going to name the military genius and failed VP candidate Lieberman, to replace Rummy.  But Rumsfeld stands by his declaration that he wasn‚Äôt going to retire any time soon.  But could the White House take this opportunity of a Republican led inquiry into the Katrina response to throw Rumsfeld under the bus and use his departments handling of the things, and not the hot potato of Iraq as the ‚Äúlast straw‚Äù to force out Rumsfeld, and temporarily deflect attention, and at the same time, protect, the so far, under the radar Andy Card?&lt;/p&gt;

Just one more disgusting fact from this administration.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gmail Web Clips</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So the new feature in GMAIL is the ‚Äúweb clip‚Äù.  Not really sure what it is, other than RSS feeds based on content of your mail.  So when checking your SPAM folder before deleting, you now get recipes for ‚ÄúSavory Spam Crescents‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGinger Spam Salad‚Äù, too funny.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html&quot;&gt;del.icio.us: y.ah.oo!&lt;/a&gt;
So the ‚Äònet is abuzz that the hot tagging service del.icio.us was bought by yahoo.  Read through the comments, some are skeptical, some simply full of congrats, some outright damning the merger.  Me, eh, I‚Äôll wait to see what happens, but will start trying to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/&quot;&gt;scuttle&lt;/a&gt;    working again, just in case.  I‚Äôve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blinklist.com&quot;&gt;Blinklist&lt;/a&gt; as well, and there‚Äôs no shortage of options out there, if yahoo does get too hands on.  I really don‚Äôt see it as this commenter &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;What happened to the decentralization the internet was supposed to be so good for?&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;because, as I‚Äôve said, there are other options out there, and will continue to grow, especially after this buy-out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>80% of Military Voted or Tried To</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/06/AR2005120601556.html?nav=rss_politics&quot;&gt;Washington Post.com&lt;/a&gt;
I‚Äôd like to know a little more about the ‚Äúefforts‚Äù of the DoD to connect soldiers with their citizenship.  While I commend the 79% that did their civic duty, and perhaps will make it a habit after they leave the military, I doubt the sincerity of the DoD‚Äôs reasons.  You had to be living in a cave in Afganhistan, (oops, no, they knew about it too) to not know about the slim margin Bush ‚Äúwon‚Äù by in ‚Äò00, and the discussions of the military often voting Republican, etc, etc, etc.  So Rummy made a concerted effort to ‚Äúget out the vote‚Äù as soon as the war started, hoping that the patriotism and general tendacies would help him keep his job for 4 more years.  Now that his job is not on the line, and the undertone of the politcal landscape is in much darker, I wonder if the DoD will make such a push for election turnout.  And more so, I wonder if the Dems can pressure the DoD to maintain the ‚Äúprogram‚Äù, and turn the knife, so to speak, on the administration.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WordPress and Linkblox</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So while doing a design for someone, I came across this site - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogbox.com/linkblox.php&quot;&gt;Linkblox&lt;/a&gt;.   Among some other flash type widgets, this one presents your links in a compact widget, especially if you have them categorized.  What‚Äôs nifty about this free widget, is that is uses OPML.  While not that familiar with it, a quick poke around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.wordpress.org&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;, I discovered that the links manager built into WordPress already outputs your links in an OPML file.  It‚Äôs found in your root WP folder at wp-links-opml.php.   The linkblox site simply asks for you to point to a OPML file, your URL, and then outputs a script  for you to place in your header and sidebar.  One for the header, one for the place you want your widget.  So what‚Äôs nice, is you can continue to use your ‚Äúlink this‚Äù bookmarklet, and keep your blogroll/links in your DB, so if the ‚Äúlinkblox‚Äù site disappears, or you decide to stop using it, you still have all your blogroll safely at your site.  The advanced customization for the widget gives you quite a bit of color customization, and the site promises this is a work in progress, which is why they are hosting the script, so that can make upgrades seamlessly behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title> Congress and the Bowl Championship Series</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2245440&amp;amp;campaign=rss&amp;amp;source=ESPNHeadlines&quot;&gt;ESPN.com-Congress to look into ‚Äòdeeply flawed‚Äô BCS system&lt;/a&gt; You have to be kidding me.  Ah, your alma matre isn‚Äôt going to the Rose Bowl this year, so it‚Äôs time to cry fowl. Boo hoo!  Try fixing the education system, or working on getting better funding for students, rather than this.  Any thing, heck, I‚Äôd rather here some discussion about giving student athletes a stipend than how the BCS is flawed.  Sure it is, so was the old bowl system.  But this is that last place Congress needs to be sticking their nose.  With record deficits, a war, corruption all over the Republican map, and this is best they‚Äôve got.  Flabergasted, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got to say. I wonder if this guy Barton is one of the ones the Texas jerrymandering case got elected?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Math Can't Hurt You</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/29/AR2005112901288.html?nav=rss_politics&quot;&gt;Zeroing Out the Messenger&lt;/a&gt; So amongst all the Iraq/memo gate/plamegate/Katrina debates, another slug of a Republican Congress man, bought by Utilities companies in Oregon, managed to have a little known, yet important center shut down.  I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/rants/judge-says-bush-salmon-plan-ignores-impact-of-dams/&quot;&gt;wrote about this&lt;/a&gt; last May, when a judge ruled the Bush plan on the spring and fall runs of Chinook  salmon was wrong, and forced new numbers to be used.  Well, that little known agency shut down by Congressman Larry Craig was responsible for using scientific means of measuring the population of the salmon.  Long story short, Craig convinced his fellow congressman to shut down funding for the agency, and it looks like my faith in the people of the Pacific Northwest was unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Abramhoff's Cancer Spreads</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/25/AR2005112501423.html&quot;&gt;Lawmakers Under Scrutiny in Probe of Lobbyist&lt;/a&gt;  I first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/rants/the-dung/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the Firm of ASG and DeLay‚Äôs wife back in April.  Here it is almost December and it‚Äôs finally becoming a legitimate news.  Some of my favorites, DeLay‚Äôs wife was paid over 3 grand a month to determine each Congress man‚Äôs favorite charity.  One would assume that could be done by a few low level staffers in a week via  email and voice calls.  And it looks more and more like DeLay is going to be smack dab in the middle of this one too.  While we‚Äôre at it, might someone look a little further into the Brian Darling connection as well.  With Bill Nelson facing a tough election next year, this could be something to take another swipe out of the Republican machine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breaking! Scanlon pleads out, to testify against Abramoff</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT-&lt;a href=&quot;http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=57059&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Scanlon also admitted‚Ä¶ he, Lobbyist A, and others engaged in a pattern of bribery through which one or both of them offered and provided a stream of things of value to public officials, including trips, campaign contributions, meals and entertainment in exchange for agreements that public officials would use their official positions and influence to benefit the clients of Scanlon and Lobbyist A as well as Lobbyist A‚Äôs businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Michael Scanlon, former DeLay aide, has pleaded guilty in a deal to agree to testify against Abramhoff.  Does this mean he has some dirt on DeLay as well?  Only time will tell.  I‚Äôm sure the Justice dept is licking its lips at this one!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WordPress 2.0 Beta</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the WP realm is talking about it, and soon the buzz around the net will too, Matt and co. quietly released WordPress 2.0 Beta 1 this afternoon.  Some have wondered the jump from 1.6 alpha to 2.0 beta, but to me, it seems a logical marketing choice.  The buzz among the net the second half of this year has been web 2.0.  Why not cash in on the hype?  I mean, apps like WordPress helped fuel that buzz, that web application movement, why should they not get in on the action?  Web apps like Flock, technorati, delicious, all rely on more tech savvy users, most who now have a blog somewhere.  Heck, Flock tied itself into WordPress.com by working out invites to wp.com for those signing up for the developer‚Äôs release.  So I say to Matt, and those who made the decision, smart move, and may the 2.0 wave continue to further the popularity and development of WordPress.  And thanks for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Milk for Oil?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://go.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=politicsNews&amp;amp;storyID=10335070&amp;amp;src=rss/ElectionCoverage&quot;&gt;Reuters.com&lt;/a&gt;
OK, so Big Oil said they didn‚Äôt need the subsidy, so Congress, trying to save some money here and there figured, hey, we‚Äôll cut the subsidy then.  Smart think guys.  But then this comes along.  Hastert, playing politics, pushes to extend an expired subsidy for dairy farmers.  Granted, an International dairy board is against the subsidy, and there‚Äôs got to be something better to do than hand money over to dairy farmers ‚Äòcause they can‚Äôt sell their milk, but, hey, when a Republican Congressman is running for Governor of Wisconsin, and Wisconsin was a ‚Äúbattle ground‚Äù state, it makes perfect sense.  According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsa.usda.gov/pas/publications/facts/html/milc02.htm&quot;&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;, The MILC (get it, milk)program is about giving milk producers money if the price drops too low.  Why then, can a Republican government that argues about free trade, and capitalism, support such a program.  Because it‚Äôs our food supply??  Not mine, I don‚Äôt drink milk.  Will they start subsidizing organic produce?  I‚Äôd much rather do that, to lower the cost to me, than give a billion dollars to commercial milk farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Export your FireFox Bookmarks to Del.icio.us on a Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is intended to be a simple tutorial for Mac OS X users.  I‚Äôm not a programmer, I didn‚Äôt even play one on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, head over to SourceForge and grab this &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/bkmrk2dlcs/&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt;.    This is assuming your downloads go to your desktop.  Second, export your FF bookmarks, for ease of explanation, to your desktop as well(make sure you select all the folders you want to export, by default, the Toolbar bookmarks are the only ones highlighted).  You should have a Folder then on your desktop BookmarksToDelicious and your bookmarks.html file (and what ever else you have on your desktop).  Now go to your Utilities folder, and open the Terminal application.  For those who are not familiar with it, you  are now officially venturing into the Unix core that you‚Äôve heard about.
Once the terminal is open, you should see a prompt that looks something like $miklb:~ miklb$.  Where miklb is the User name that you use on your machine.  The first step is to move to the actual directory where the python script is, which is your BookmarksToDelicious folder on the desktop.  Again, this is a bare bones explanation, for non-technical users, so feel free to comment if there‚Äôs a quicker way.
To get to the folder, first type: cd Desktop.  The prompt should now be miklb$:~/Desktop miklb$. (Don‚Äôt forget, yours won‚Äôt be miklb, it will be what ever your user name is).
Next, type cd BookmarksToDelicious.
We are now in the folder the file is we want to execute.  Almost there.
At this point you need to know your del.icio.us user name and password.  For example purposes, I‚Äôm going to use the fictional user name of Alice, and password of Wonderland.  Again, this is assuming your bookmarks are on the desktop.  If not, you need to know the full path to that file.  But if you‚Äôre following along, the next command to type into terminal is:
&lt;strong&gt;python BookmarksToDelicious.py ‚Äì ‚Äìusername Alice ‚Äì ‚Äìpassword Wonderland ‚Äìsubmit ‚Äìdebug /Users/miklb/Desktop/bookmarks.html&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where miklb is again the username you have on your machine, which is going to be the same as your prompt in the terminal.
If all goes well, you will begin to a lot of action scrolling down the page, and then the actual bookmarks going into del.icio.us, with a line saying ‚ÄúGetting‚Äù, then some code, then  	&amp;#38; result code =‚Äùdone‚Äù /,  	&amp;#38; for each bookmark.
The script will put tags on each bookmark with the folder name for that bookmark.  So if you have a folder called Apple in the folder toolbar-bookmarks, that will be the tag structure you get for the bookmark.  You can then edit that in del.icio.us, or, you can redo your folder structure in FF prior to export, which ever  you prefer.
Also note, it‚Äôs not neccessary to use the ‚Äìdebug command, I simply included it, as it may be nice to see something happen, and know when it‚Äôs done.  Working in Terminal, generally speaking, it doesn‚Äôt show anything happening, so a new user may not know what‚Äôs going on.  Seeing stuff scroll down the screen helps.  If you run into a problem, you can leave a comment, and I‚Äôll do my best to help, but again, this is meant as a bare-bones-I-couldn‚Äôt-find-a-better-option way of doing this, and wanted to share, as I didn‚Äôt come across many other explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who Hired This Guy??</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/17/AR2005111701879.html?nav=rss_politics&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; OK, sure, when ever you‚Äôve got billions of dollars flowing around with out a check and balance system, there‚Äôs bound to be some corruption.  Much has been made about the no-bid contracts, the mis-management of money by the Bremer lead provisional Authority, and finally formal charges have been levied.  My question is this?  Who their right mind hired this guy Stein to work their in the first place.  Talk about fox in the hen house.  Guy was found guilty of fraud in ‚Äò96, spent some time in jail even.  Hello!!  He even paid some of his restitution from the previous crime with the kickbacks he got for this one.  His wife paid taxes! 3 years late!  I‚Äôd love, just love to know who he &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; to get the job.  And I‚Äôd like to hear how it wasn‚Äôt thought out on how to hire people to oversee &lt;strong&gt;REGIONS&lt;/strong&gt; without proper background checks.  This wasn‚Äôt a low level guy getting a few thousand dollars, this was a guy who got .5 million in kickbacks for fixing over 13 million in contracts, which never really were done.  And the investigator says 50 more are being looked at.  More examples of poor planning by the administration.  Thank God though they were able to ‚Äúnegotiate‚Äù the deals with Haliburton months before the invasion‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alex King asks, Should I Host Another WordPress Theme Competition?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So with the impending release of WP 1.6, Alex King &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexking.org/blog/2005/11/09/another-wordpress-theme-competition/&quot;&gt;ponders&lt;/a&gt; the pluses and minuses of hosting another theme contest, and asked for opinions.  So as someone who came along WP as he was starting his second contest, may I add that the primary thing I remember from that contest, and perhaps should be consider if a third comes along, is the delineation of where one theme ends and another begins.  If I take Kubrick, put a new header on it, change some fonts and colors, is that a new theme?  I realize that is a fine line, but with a panel in place to screen a theme that‚Äôs hosted on the contestants own site, a consensus can be reached as whether or not it‚Äôs original.
Second suggestion, phases of judging.  Contestants host the design, and each category is narrowed, to say, 3.  At that point, the theme is then put on a clean install to test the safety, and code.  Thus eliminating some of the worries.
But I will say, the second contest was surely a motivator to get more involved with WP and explore its community, which subsequently opened my eyes to many more things web related.  Where my knowledge is now, can only be contributed to my exposure to WP at that point.  And I can only hope that 1.6 and a theme contest does that for someone lese like my self.  So I encourage and will support, be it $$ or time, to see that another does happen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;How bloody cool is this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zazzle.com/stamps/&quot;&gt;ZazzleStamps&lt;/a&gt; your own image on a real, licensed stamp.  I think 20 stamps is around $16, and the more you buy, the cheaper they get.  And if you‚Äôve got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; account, then you can easily choose an image from there for the stamp.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Plazes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading an aside at &lt;a href=&quot;http://photomatt.com&quot;&gt;Matt‚Äôs blog&lt;/a&gt; regarding Plazes using WP for its blog, I decided to check it out.  My &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.plazes.com/plaze/a346284130ad346f75da8ea2f4520c13/#&quot;&gt;Plaze&lt;/a&gt;, and it really seems like it could be kinda cool, if it catches on.  It‚Äôd be nice to know about some hot spots when traveling, or just around town.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Intelligent Design takes hit in Pennsylvania</title>

Take heed school boards, your career may very well be short lived if you decide to force this concept on your district.  Read the score, &lt;strong&gt;8 out of 9&lt;/strong&gt; incumbents lost their seat.  Even the winners were surprised by the results.  People in Tampa may very well be watching this, as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sptimes.com/2005/11/08/Tampabay/Board_restores_religi.shtml&quot;&gt;debate over holidays rages on.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bush‚Äôs response has been so far to not comment, and send his entire staff, including Rove, to ethics class.  A whole hour long on how to handle classified documents.  That‚Äôs the best he‚Äôs got?  Not quite the ‚Äúheads will roll if anyone in my administration was involved‚Äù attitude his little John Wayne act tried.  I‚Äôm sure though the Republican‚Äôs will applaud such a move.

        <title>Gmail invites?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are gmail invites still used?  I mean, I have 100 to offer, but damned if I know what to do with them.  Heck, even my two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; invites are moot now with the whole Flock thing.  Anyway, if you need one give me a shout.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title> Bad Behavior 2 Roadmap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With all the buzz around the net discussing Akismet, which, to me, is just another hype for wordpress.com, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://error.wordpress.com/2005/10/25/bad-behavior-2-roadmap/&quot;&gt;IOerror‚Äôs discussion&lt;/a&gt; of his roadmap for Bad Behaivor 2.  Again, people are praising Akismet as the second coming of Christ, and if that is the case, then the combination of Spam Karma and Bad Behavior is the first coming.  Along with the roadmap, IOError discusses the reality of what it will take for him to be able to knock out the new version, CA$H.  Quite understandable, hell, this blogger had to go back to his prior profession for the exact same reason.  But the case of Bad Behavior is simple, if 100 bloggers such as this one has already done and donated a mere $10, we would in essence be hiring a full time spam fighter.  So let this be a challenge to other bloggers, jump on the bandwagon and use Kismet, or support the developer who set the standard in the first place.  I‚Äôm from the school of ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù, so therefore I‚Äôm not disabling my two working anti-spam plugins to try the flavor of the week, I‚Äôd rather see the BB2 come down the pipe a month or so from now.  It‚Äôs up to you now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Well, It's a Start</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve managed to go through my first 140 or so posts and add tags via the Ultimate Tag Warrior plugin, so the concept of ‚Äúcategories‚Äù is now all but moot here at Mindless Ramblings.  Hence the tag ‚Äúcloud‚Äù in the middle.  I‚Äôve recently purchased a new camera phone with the hopes of moblogging some, but the flickr gallery plugin I‚Äôm trying to use is beta, maybe more like alpha, but hopefully I‚Äôll get it to work, until then, don‚Äôt click the gallery link.  I did do a little modification to the squible default style.css, but aside from a different image on the lead post and some colors changes, it‚Äôs straight out of the box.  It‚Äôs such a different theme, that until I work through it more, it‚Äôs kinda hard to start changing things.  Again, stay out of the gallery please, it‚Äôs not quite ready, but I may need it live to help trouble shoot the install.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pardon the dust</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to get back to blogging, and fishing, and just about anything else healthy I can do to avoid hanging out late at night drinking Jagermeister and sitting in a smoky room, I‚Äôm going to change themes, and try to focus on the laptop and online more.  So if things go wacky or seem odd, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/blog/contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; with a heads up.  Oh, and if you see anything new you like, you can always comment on that also.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Odd Referral</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely check my stats packages anymore like awstats and the like, I simply use the stat page I created on this site with a plugin or two.  A recent referral was a google search, ‚Äúhow to steal WordPress theme‚Äù.  Why would someone want to ‚Äústeal‚Äù a theme?  Obviously they got to my site due to my blank WordPress theme, but there are hundreds of themes out there, and dozens of sites with info on how to customize them.  So why ‚Äústeal‚Äù.  Its not like you can‚Äôt copy and paste anyone‚Äôs CSS and use it on your own, the only issues are with custom php codes on the templates.  Sad really.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Another Miss by the Hammer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Good ol‚Äô Tom has now moved to have his judge recuse himself from the case because, among other organizations, he‚Äôs donated to Moveon.org.  So what does he want, someone who‚Äôs donated to the RNC or one of his own PACs?  Or simply a judge that hasn‚Äôt donated to any political affliations?  To me, it‚Äôs just another desperate move by a rat backed into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;

Alas, the world keeps turning, and so does the clown rodeo kown as the Tomd DeLay defense.  His lawyers are know trying to squash the money laundering because ‚Äúwire transfers are not ‚Äòfunds‚Äô ‚Äú‚Ä¶ if that‚Äôs not a backhanded admission of guilt, nothing is.  ‚ÄúIf the glove does not fit, you must acquit‚Äù.  And to further the never give in persona of ol‚Äô Hammer, he passed on a plea offer of a misdemeanor charge of violating Texas election laws, thus the felony charges that he currently faces.  Tom, you shoulda listened closer to the &lt;em&gt;Gambler&lt;/em&gt;, ‚Äúyou gotta know when to hold ‚Äòem, know when to fold ‚Äòem‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at200524_model.html&quot;&gt;computer models&lt;/a&gt; have her slightly lower than the Tampa area, the most recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT4+shtml/190236.shtml&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; talks of some slightly different motion than previously forcast, and how the recent NOAA jet‚Äôs flight data would have on the models.  Keep an eye out folks, it ain‚Äôt over yet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No U2 fundraising for Santorum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I haven‚Äôt blogged in a while, and yes, I‚Äôve been busy cooking for a living again.  However that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt intend to continue blogging, nor do I completely ignore the news.  That said, I was shocked when I heard on the news today that U2 was doing a fundraiser for Rick Santorum.  Then I read over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://joetrippi.com&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi‚Äôs site &lt;/a&gt; that ol‚Äô Santorum and the conservative news blogs got the message wrong.&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;Santorum . . . you may want to wipe those eggs off of your face&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
And was just starting to think the world was really slipping off its axis. Whew!  Not just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tampa Blogging</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was checking my recent referers, and saw that I had several referals from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seminoleheights.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Seminole Heights Blog&lt;/a&gt;, and the discussion of the bay area being ‚Äúblog capital of Florida‚Äù.   I rarely discuss Tampa issues, and funny enough, I just came across an &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBAWR2F6EE.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; at tbo.com discussing Tampa officials wanting to ease laws regarding gifts of tickets.  When I read the article, I almost wrote about it then.  But after reading the discussion, I feel I must touch on it. 
&lt;!--more--&gt;
The article discusses the desire of Iorio and city council members wanting to be allowed to accept tickets that cost more than the $100 that they are currently allowed to accept.  And my question is this, what events are you wanting to go to that cost more than $100?  The article discusses ‚Äúcommunity events‚Äù, but I‚Äôm not aware of these events.  If they are fundraisers rather than community events, I would question who is raising the funds, and why exactly do they need the mayor or a city council person there?  Iorio discusses a USF game recently.  Last time I checked, tickets were less than $100 to the game.  Likewise in Dingfelder‚Äôs Bucs game issues.  Tickets can cost much less than $100.  Now, in my humble opinion, if these elected officials want to hang out in a luxury box, and eat a catered meal, drink top-shelf cocktails while watching a football game rather than sit in the seats with those who elected them, then they should pay for the difference out of their pocket.  Likewise, if it‚Äôs a fundraiser, be it children‚Äôs causes or Gasparilla, I‚Äôm uncomfortable with event planners being able to bring in the mayor for free, which may be a ‚Äúselling point‚Äù to those wealthy enough to attend.  Smells fishy all ready.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, in my humble opinion, if these elected officials want to hang out in a luxury box, and eat a catered meal, drink top-shelf cocktails while watching a football game rather than sit in the seats with those who elected them, then they should pay for the difference out of their pocket.  Likewise, if it‚Äôs a fundraiser, be it children‚Äôs causes or Gasparilla, I‚Äôm uncomfortable with event planners being able to bring in the mayor for free, which may be a ‚Äúselling point‚Äù to those wealthy enough to attend.  Smells fishy all ready.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&quot;Culture of Corruption&quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As some who‚Äôve read here before, you know I‚Äôve looked forward to this day for some time.  The only thing I look forward to more now is the day Tom DeLay is found guilty of at least some of his crimes against this country.  To me, he‚Äôs committed treason.  He‚Äôs cheated and lied to the American people, and circumvented the law, which thereby prevented the people of Texas from rightly electing their officials.  But this is all fairly main stream news.  What I‚Äôve found more interesting is the mantra the democratic party line is using in the recent criminal charges/investigations‚Ä¶‚Äúculture of corruption‚Äù.  When election time rolls around in ‚Äò06, expect that phrase to be played out over and over.  I think that will be the real ‚Äúplatform‚Äù for unseating the Republicans.  I think it can be used in just about every situation from the appointment of Brown to FEMA to the gerrymandering issues in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>And for the Main Event...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, Katrina Vanden Hueval and Ann Coulter were part of Larry King‚Äôs panel discussing the DeLay indictment. However, the difference is those two were in the studio with King, whereas the others where off-studio cameras.  As usual, Coulter had to try and get the last word, wouldn‚Äôt answer King‚Äôs questions (I‚Äôll give it to the old softy, he sorta tried to ask the hard questions), and basically came across as her lunatic self.  Vanden Hueval surprised me when she even joined the mantra of ‚Äúculture of corruption‚Äù.  Ultimately, it was a matter of two diametrically opposed political commentators, and nothing new was added.  But at times, it looked like there could be a cat fight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Brewing Storm of a Different Nature</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092301811.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; While the nation‚Äôs eyes have been focused on Rita, and Houston‚Äôs failure to properly coordinate evacuation traffic, another storm was brewing in Republican politics.  Much in the manner that Martha Stewart was originally charged with insider trading, or something similar, Senator Bill Frist-R of Tennessee is being investigated by the Security Exchange Commission regarding sales of stock this past summer.&lt;br /&gt;
Well it appears that Mr Frist owned a fair amount of stock in a company originally founded by his father, and over the summer, Frist order the blind trust to sell the shares.  Where the investigation comes in is the fact that soon after the sale by Frist, poor earnings reports were issued, and the price of the stock dropped significantly from the high it was when Frist sold.  There‚Äôs no indication that Frist‚Äôs family is completely divorced from the business, and there‚Äôs no indication that Frist didn‚Äôt know those in positions of power with the company.&lt;br /&gt;
It is quite hard for me to believe that Frist simply was the recipient of good luck, and that it was purely a coincidence.  For someone who‚Äôs been discussed as a potential Presidential nominee, and currently the Senate majority leader, even the hint of misappropriateness will linger, and a discovery of wrong doing will not only ruin his political career, it will go a long way of painting the current Republican party as one of double standards and, as Dean said ‚Äúmade their culture of corruption the norm‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No More Free NY Times</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looks like starting tomorrow, the NY Times is handcuffing its content.  Rather, handcuffing its readers.  Times Select, they‚Äôre calling it.  $40 bucks a year if you sign up by today, $50 otherwise.  Sure, some of the stuff will be free, but the good stuff, the Maureen Dowd articles, well, that‚Äôll cost you.  However, in addition to the current content, the subscription will get you access to 100 archived articles a month.  And, if you subscribe to home delivery, then it‚Äôll be free.  What to do, what to do.  (Anyone want to split a subscription?)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Just a test, move along...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I can post with this contraption, but I don‚Äôt see all the options.  I see a thing for categories, but I can‚Äôt see how to add them.  This wouldn‚Äôt be very handy if I‚Äôm stuck with the generic default category.    I do like the idea however, of having a single interface that I post from.  So my WP Station blog, cookingwith, etc. all come from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; OK, so I quit, and reloaded MarsEdit, and was able to ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù my site, and categories loaded.  Good.  I‚Äôll add my cooking site later, to see how that handles a multitude of categories.  I‚Äôm also curious about tags, but that‚Äôs for another post.  I‚Äôm starting to like this ‚Äúblogging client‚Äù situation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bush Administration Wins Emmy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, in a round about way.  John Stewart and his show &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt; won an Emmy Last night for some kind of comedy show.  I didn‚Äôt watch the awards, rarely have.  I was busy with my own comedy of errors, but that‚Äôs another story.  But in some fashion, if he didn‚Äôt do it last night, Stewart has to share that award with the Bush administration.  Know that Stewart is an equal opportunity critic, and his jokes are only pointed towards those who blow it, not one party or another.&lt;br /&gt;
But my real question is this - Does this award create an even greater undercurrent of anti-administration disdain, or does painting &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt; as pure comedy, and not satire, minimize the sad truth that is at the core of most of Stewart‚Äôs show?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blogging with MarsEdit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôve been looking at some Mac OS X apps, for various tasks.  I‚Äôve started using RSS more and more, and I‚Äôm not too keen on the Sage extension for FireFox.  Mainly because of screen real estate on the ol‚Äô ibook.  NetNewsWire seems to be the choice, and through that, I‚Äôm playing with Mars Edit, a blogging app.  So this is my fist attempt at blogging outside the web interface.  If it works out, it may be an easier way to post, if nothing more than the built in spell check.  We‚Äôll see about the other features.  Downside is it‚Äôs not a free app, so it better well prove to invaluable, or when its trial runs out, to the curb with it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>They Said No One Anticipated It - Hurricane Pam</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Much has been written and discussed regarding the preparedness, or lack there of, in Louisiana, and surrounding areas, especially regarding the levees.  So much to my surprise, I get an email today from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.factcheck.org&quot;&gt; Factcheck.org &lt;/a&gt;, and it leads off with a link to the Louisiana Department of Homeland Security.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/newsrelated/incaseofemrgencyexercise.htm&quot;&gt;link &lt;/a&gt; is a repost of a Times Picayune article outlining a dry run done July of 2004, before Charley and Ivan, of the effects of a &lt;strong&gt;Cat 3&lt;/strong&gt; storm on the levees and underlying parishes.  Just another example of ineptness, and deceptions the administration continue to hide from.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9314188/#050916&quot;&gt; Brian Williams - MSNBC.com&lt;/a&gt; Is reporting that miraculously a half hour before the Prez arrived for his big speech, the power came on in New Orleans.  And like clockwork, an hour after he left, it went off.  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a &lt;em&gt;logical explanation&lt;/em&gt;  I mean, those left behind don‚Äôt really need it for anything, do they?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>High and Tight</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/12/AR2005091200642.html&quot;&gt;‚ÄòJudges Are Not Politicians,‚Äô Roberts Says&lt;/a&gt;
I‚Äôm not quite sure ‚Äòol John is really a baseball fan.  I‚Äôm sure George Will could give a few better analogies than calling balls and strikes if he‚Äôs looking to paint himself as a straight shooter.  Anyone who watches baseball knows that sure, there‚Äôs a strike zone, but every home plate umpire calls a slightly different strike zone.  And some call a different strike zone for veteran players than rookies.  Jeter doesn‚Äôt neccessarily get the called third strike that Julio Lugo does.  And one guy may call low and outside a strike after the third, and another gives the pitcher a wider strike zone.  So therein lies the question Mr Roberts, &lt;em&gt;where is &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; strike zone&lt;/em&gt;?  Are you going to give the pitcher the outside pitch, or are you going to call ‚Äòem high and tight?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Poor Mr Brown</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Poor, poor, Mike Brown.  He feels humiliated that he was pulled out of New Orleans.  How bloody humiliated are the people living in conditions in the hurricane stricken region?   How much money of ours has been squandered in the lack of preparation?  And to that end, is this another ‚Äúfalling on the sword‚Äù loyal lap dog?  At what point will the Bush administration, and Bush specifically be held responsible for appointing lap dogs like Brown.  How many deaths will it take?  Obviously more than 2000, as Iraq has proven.  But how about the 45 dead bodies that were found in the hospital today?  Were they preventable?  I wonder how they felt about the privatization of Social Security?&lt;/p&gt;

So far, he‚Äôs found no explanation.  Good one McClellan.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bush Suspends Minimum Wage in Federal Contracts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050908-5.html&quot;&gt;Proclamation&lt;/a&gt; Apparently, there‚Äôs provisions that state the Labor Secretary sets a minumum wage to pay various levels of laborers and ‚Äúmechanics‚Äù.  Well, Bush has suspended this provision.   It‚Äôs written into the provision that he can, and in some circumstances, I can understand why.  But we are talking about Bush, and Cheney, and I can see how some corporate contractors seize an opportunity to not pay laborers a federally mandated min. rate, but still charge their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fees.  So prior to the Hurricane, a skilled worker in NO would have been paid a certain rate if working on a federal contract, now he will be paid less.  Good thing those tax cuts went to those who needed it most‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shameless Plug #1001</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I started the WordPress ‚Äúfan‚Äù site recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpstation.com&quot;&gt;WordPress Station&lt;/a&gt;, and recently got it its own domain.  And while surfing around, I found an open source design that was a hack of Apple‚Äôs brushed metal design.  There was a brushed metal theme for WP when I first started using it, but it‚Äôs disappeared.  Not sure why, but I figured there might be a few who‚Äôd want to give it a run.  Therefore, I‚Äôm in the process of porting it to WP, and have it in ‚Äúbeta‚Äù over at WPstation.  Plus, I‚Äôve been busy working with an upstart hosting company, and will begin offering a great deal on a basic hosting package VERY soon.
Now if I could only motivate myself to post over at cookingwith more‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jacob.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Jacob Appelbaum?s weblog&lt;/a&gt;
Jacob‚Äôs blogging from Houston, where he and some other SF Bay area volunteers are trying to team up with volunteers from Austin and surrounding areas to set up a Low Powered FM radio.  They have a license from the FCC, all the equipment, including a standing offer of 10,000 radios for the residents‚Ä¶the purpose, to easily disseminate information to the 10,000+ displaced New Orleans residents, now living in the Astrodome.  Seems perhaps &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; doesn‚Äôt want some ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù to trickle down to those that need it.&lt;br /&gt;
And I haven‚Äôt heard one cable network touch on this, though it seems the LA Times have half the story.  Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkprogress.org/katrina-timeline&quot;&gt;Think Progress &lt;/a&gt;has put together a very good time line of events, easily outlining the total failure and lies from this administration.  Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinylittledots.com&quot;&gt;tiny &lt;/a&gt; for the link.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hammer Sighting...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, we knew it wouldn‚Äôt be long, but the Hammer has reared his ugly head, at the behest of the White House, I‚Äôm sure, to run interference.  The lamb is being dressed‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;West: I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, &quot;They're looting.&quot; You see a white family, it says, &quot;They're looking for food.&quot; ...and they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!...&lt;strong&gt;George Bush doesn't care about black people!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Rehnquist Passes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As if our country doesn‚Äôt have enough on its plate, it is being reported Chief Justice Rehnquist died today.  So we are still arguing the merits of Roberts (to no avail), and now the discussion of which ultra-right wing judge will move up to replace Scalia, as he moves to Chief Justice.  Unless Bush pulls the PR move and names Sandra Day O‚ÄôConner, he has found the perfect distraction from his debacle in the delta.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where's George?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Potentially one of the worst natural disasters in the last 25 years, a breakdown in the Iraqi constitution, soaring crude oil prices, and where‚Äôs George?  Hunkering down in Mississippi?  No.  Meeting with experts on alternative energy? NO.  Bringing together representatives of the Sunni and Shiite factions to work out a compromise? Hell no.  He‚Äôs sitting with a bunch of retirees in Sun City stroking them about the advantages of privatized Social Security.  Oh, sure, you say, ‚Äúhe did tell the folks in Lousiana and Mississippi that the country would pray for them.  You know, on second thought, go back to Crawford George, and take the rest of the year off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; Just to be clear, the link is to a soldier in Iraq who passed away a couple of weeks ago.  You can read his last entry, and then in the comments, see the news.  I highly suggest reading more of entries, and look at his bio page.  That‚Äôs why I said this shit has just got to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Netflix for your Playstation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we use Netflix, and it‚Äôs great.  Even if I don‚Äôt watch a film for 2 weeks, it‚Äôs there, and I don‚Äôt feel too guilty for only watching 3-4 films in a month, it still only costs the $18, roughly.  Anyway, just saw a commercial for &amp;lt;a http://www.gamefly.com‚Äù&amp;gt;Game Fly&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a Netflix clone for video games. 2 games at a time for $21.95.  Certainly would beat dropping $50 to find out a game flat out sucks, and try and dump it on ebay for $30, to try and recoup your lost.  Will let you know how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Current.tv</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So with the ever growing trend in cable news to simply discuss missing boyfriends of washed up pop stars, and missing 18 year olds, I‚Äôve found myself looking for something else to have on in the background.  Enter current.tv or as the info on the cable says, google current.  We all heard about it, Al Gore, blah blah, &lt;em&gt;insert created Internet joke here&lt;/em&gt;.  But it‚Äôs not bad.  Most of what I‚Äôve seen is ‚Äúviewer created‚Äù shorts.  Nothing has been ‚Äúbad‚Äù, and some of it has been poignant.  Certainly beats Fox News, or should I say, ‚ÄúJennifer Holloway, 24/7‚Äù.  What was Jon Stewart saying the other night, 14 Americans died in Iraq, and Fox still ran Van Sustren and the Holloway story.
Right now they are showing the top 10 Clicked News Stories, and how ironic, the #1 story was ‚ÄúNewton‚Äôs Partner seen alive‚Äù‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When Things Are Going Good...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When things are going good, they are really good.  I can‚Äôt say a bad thing about my life right now, looking forward to my classes, have a great paying job lined up that starts in a month, doing some cool stuff on the web, just over all good.  So my printer went out.  An Epson 5400 all-in-one.  Bought it about 16 months ago for $130 after rebates.  But we bought the 2 year warranty.  So, I go to trade it in today, and obviously the 5400 is an older model.  They‚Äôve got the 6600.  Ok, they credit me the $150, the 6600 is $189 after instant rebate.  Eh, $39 isn‚Äôt bad.  But wait.  There are some mail in rebates.  How much you ask.  $110 worth!!!  So, I pay $80 out of my pocket today, will get $110 back within 6 weeks, have a brand new printer, and a 2 year no questions asked warranty.  Sweet!
Even without the trade in deal, you can get that printer for $79 through the 26th of August at CompUSA.  Still not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kudos to Costas </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nytimes.com/2005/08/24/arts/television/24cost.html&quot;&gt;Bob Costas Says No to Hour on Aruba - New York Times&lt;/a&gt; A sad story sure, but women of all ages and ethnic backgrounds go missing all over the world, and do not receive one minute of news coverage.  I certainly wonder if all the advertising $$ that the cable news networks have taken in during segments on the Holloway case were applied to missing and exploited womens groups, what the effect would be.&lt;br /&gt;
That said, Costas, whom I‚Äôve mentioned in a previous post as a solid fill in for King, turned down the gig based on the subject.  Clearly Costas wants to do ‚Äúreal‚Äù stories, I‚Äôm sure he gets enough fluff doing ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù stories for the Olympics.  Anyway, good for you Bob.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When In Doubt, Lie</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I caught part of the President‚Äôs speech today at the VFW conference today, and as the pressure is mounting on both sides of the aisle (that was Republican Chuck Hagel, Vietnam Vet, saying that Iraq was looking more and more like Vietnam, right?), and what did I hear him invoke?  Ah, the old September 11th mantra.  Is he foolish enough to think that people are still buying that, or am I foolish enough to think people have seen through the smoke screen and realize that Iraq has nothing to do Sept 11.  Either way, with all the bickering and jostling for election positions, the GOP sure isn‚Äôt sending a united message, and the Dems are still figuring out how Dean got elected to head the party.  Meanwhile, I feel we are on a ship at 1/2 throttle with the wheel tied off so we just keep going in a big circle.  Every once in a while, we see land, and think we are going to be ok, only to veer away, back to sea.  Please, can we find someone, anyone, to stand up and take the wheel?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More Bush vs the Environment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nwf.org/news/story.cfm?pageId=CF6AB0CE%2DC448%2D7D7B%2DBCFE5BF6F6A8F55D&quot;&gt;Howl of the Wolf May be Heard Again in Northern Forest - National Wildlife Federation&lt;/a&gt;In an attempt to once again circumvent the law, the Bush administration attempted to lump several subspecies of the Grey Wolf together to so as to take the NE Grey Wolf off the endangered list.  Luckily, a judge didn‚Äôt see it that way, and ruled that there was no evidence that the research from several years ago was reversed.
In a related note, a similar case was ruled on on the West Coast regarding a species of salamander, in which the administration tried to lump several species together so as to remove them from the endangered species list.&lt;br /&gt;
One can only assimilate that the reason to remove these species is so development can infringe on the habitat of these endangered species.  I‚Äôd like to know a little more about what kind of development that would be.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Farewell Gonzo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/20/AR2005082000422.html&quot;&gt;From the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;
A farewell bang is set this evening for Hunter S Thompson‚Äôs remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it‚Äôs a blast.  To have friends like that, he had to have been everything we think him to be.  I even forgive him for his pathetic bashing of the Bucs before the Superbowl.  But what better team than the Raiders, the perennial bad boys, for Thompson to be a fan of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No man is so foolish but he may sometimes give another good counsel, and no man so wise that he may not easily err if he takes no other counsel than his own. He that is taught only by himself has a fool for a master.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>The Situation Room</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What in the world is this really?  Is CNN trying to steal Al Gore‚Äôs cable network ideas?  All the monitors, Wolf wandering around like he‚Äôs at mission control.  It‚Äôs not real, is it?  And now they‚Äôve moved the blogger babes out from the little desk with the laptops and 23in monitors, to their own set with GIANT monitors, and now they‚Äôre standing too.  I kinda liked the fact that they seemed they were in a back room surfing on their laptops.  Now, it‚Äôs just so, blah.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>As if I Didn't Have Enough To Do</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have this personal blog, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://cookingwith.miklb.com&quot;&gt;cooking blog&lt;/a&gt;, school starting, and going back to work full time in a kitchen a couple months from now, I‚Äôve started &lt;a href=&quot;http://miklb.mojomega.com/wordpress/&quot;&gt;another blog&lt;/a&gt;, this one specific to the WordPress community.  Plugin announcments, new themes, WP news in general.  It came about as I‚Äôm working with some developers who are beginning a hosting company, with some added features.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
  As most hosting services offer some sort of auto install of the many popular open-source free scripts available, most do not offer any support for those scripts.  This hosting service intends on being different.  They will offer built in support for installation and customization.  Being the WordPress fan that I am, I intend on working in that area, as well as being a liason with developers of other open-source scripts.  Another reason I have joined this development, is they intend to put their money where their mouth is, so to speak, and give back in the form of cold hard cash to the  development of the scripts.  The basic workings will be that a percentage of profit from any customization of a script will go back to that script.  So if you joined the host, and hired them to write a custom theme and install plugins for your WordPress install,  a percentage of that would go back to WordPress.  Not to mention, a link to each scripts donation box is given, so that end users can directly donate to the development of the scripts themselves, of they so feel inclined.  A vast difference from fantastico in cpanel with a huge disclaimer that no support is offered, and a link to the script‚Äôs web site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&amp;quot;Blank&amp;quot; WordPress Theme</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I‚Äôm offering up an updated, beta version &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miklb.com/wordpress-blank-theme-v2beta/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as I‚Äôve begun designing WordPress themes, I found the tutorial over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbangiraffe.com/themes/guides&quot;&gt;Urban Giraffe&lt;/a&gt; invaluable.  They walk you through the dissection of the default Kubrick theme, how to strip it down to bare bones, and start with a blank style sheet.  Now that I‚Äôve done that a couple of times, I decided it would be nice to have all the work done, and be able to have all the template files cleaned, as well as a style sheet with all the divs and classes there, simply without the style.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
 So rather than changing an existing sheet, it‚Äôs a blank canvass or sorts, but kinda like a paint by numbers as well.
Bear in mind, I may have missed a few elements, and if you discover one missing, please comment.  My goal is to have as thorough a starting point as possible.  Also note, numerous additional divs and classes can be added, this is simply a starting point, but covers as much of the basics as possible.
One last note, &lt;strong&gt;this is not a theme, it is a stripped down version of the default theme, which contains all the templates necessary, as well as a style sheet that is missing the style&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you simply upload this ‚Äútheme‚Äù and activate it, you will have zero styling, meaning no widths, no margins, no clearing.  So please do not comment that the theme didn‚Äôt work, or does not appear properly on your site.  This is solely meant for someone who wants to follow along with the tutorial, or who like me, wants some of the dirty work out of the way, and just wants to start styling a theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd love to see what people do with the Blank Theme, so please post a link to any new themes you design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final note, I eliminated the ‚Äúnarrowcolumn‚Äù and ‚Äúwidecolumn‚Äù, and wrapped everything in the div- wrapper, as Urban Giraffe did.  I found it was much easier to create a theme that works in all browsers and platforms by following that concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blank Theme can be downloaded &amp;lt;here .&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Domino Falls </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some may know that I had a string of posts regarding Tom Delay, and though he keeps his nose out of the public eye lately, an associate of his has not had the same opportunity.  In a case unrelated to his lobbying shenanigans, Jack Abramoff is facing numerous fraud charges stemming from a partnership he was involved in that purchased the SunCruz Casinos several years back.  Coupled with that purchase, is the still unsolved gangland style murder of the man whom the partners purchased the gambling boat line from.  At what point does some draw a connection between a lobbyist buying a gambling boat line, representing gambling interests, and a man shot dead in a hail of gun fire?  To that, at what point does someone question the nature of his relationship to the Republican power, as in the likes of Delay?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Urban Fishing at its Best</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahh.  Red tide, heat indexes of 105¬∫ +, rising housing costs, traffic, Jeb Bush‚Ä¶all reasons to hate living in Florida, and Tampa in particular.  But this morning, I walked for three hours in waist deep water, watching aquatic life teeming around me, all the while with the ‚Äútwin cities‚Äù of Tampa and St. Petersburg bookending my morning.&lt;br /&gt;
Granted, I misapplied my sunscreen, thus I have splotchy red spots, and my fishing partner took home the grand prize of a 24 inch red (drum) fish, however, my world sorta slipped back onto its axis, as I maintained my realization that 5am drunken rooftop parties are no longer for me.
 Drop me a contact if you live in the Tampa Bay area and would like to experience the splendor that is Florida land based fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don't Blink...Hurricane Irene</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt Blink, don‚Äôt turn away, but the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at200509_model.html&quot;&gt;computer model&lt;/a&gt; has Irene turning back to the SW and heading towards good ol‚Äô FLA.  Not that you will see that in the National Hurricane Center forcast until the other models pickup on it, but, after last year, I don‚Äôt take anything for granted.
Check the lantern for mantles kiddies, ‚Äòtis the season.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>If I had been Bush...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, the trials and tribulations of off line life vs on line life‚Ä¶Anyway, I was sitting with some friends, talking geek talk, and made a political analogy off the top of my head, that after second thought, wasn‚Äôt a bad idea, in some contexts.  The idea was this‚Ä¶if the right wing machine was &lt;em&gt;so-o-o-o&lt;/em&gt; worried about one Hillary Rodham-Clinton running for president, and the effects a Hillary presidency would have on the agenda, then why not appoint &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; to the Supreme Court?  She was a Washington lawyer at one time, and there was discussion of appointing a non judge anyways.  It would have totally taken the wind out of the lefts sails, and taken her out of any running for presidency.  Sure, she would have been some what influential on the Supreme Court, but she would have been only one of nine.  Then they could have put a serious conservative to replace Rehnquist, and set a conservative to be Chief Justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah well, it was a common sense and Microsoft analogy anyways‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Was It  Too Good To Be True</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/24/AR2005072401201.html&quot;&gt;Roberts Listed in Federalist Society ‚Äò97-98 Directory&lt;/a&gt;
So it seemed that there was no real ‚Äúdirt‚Äù to stick to Roberts, that perhaps the White House nominated a ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù, who just happened to be nominated by the right.  Even former lawyer for Clinton endorsed him.  (Not that I take that too far).  But now it‚Äôs coming out, that Roberts is a card carrying member of the ultra conservative right, and worse, he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúrecall‚Äù getting his card.  How do you head a steering committee and not remember.  Or worse,  fake an association with a club simply for personal gain, only later to deny it.  Is that the best America has to put on the Supreme Court?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Konfabulator Now Freeware</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.widgetgallery.com/&quot;&gt;Konfabulator - Gallery&lt;/a&gt;
So, after Apple sees the popularity of the widget,  they incorporate the idea into Tiger, without as much as a kiss before they screwed the developers of Konfabulator (or that‚Äôs how I read it, when the widgets were first previewed), and thus taking the feet right out beneath the developer.  Thus, Konfabulator is released as freeware. With Versiontracker filled with widget after widget, and me still plugging away with Panther, I just might stick a few up on the desktop to ‚Äúpretend‚Äù to be hangin‚Äô with Jones.
&lt;strong&gt;Edit*&lt;/strong&gt;Ah, Yahoo bought Konfabulator, and had every intention to make it free.  So alls well, that ends well.  And I did grab a couple of widgets for fun‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yet Another View on the Wilson's</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I never read the USA Today, online or else where, but somehow stumbled onto this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-07-24-wilson-neighbor_x.htm&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; from the Wilson‚Äôs lawyer.  Turns out he didn‚Äôt become &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; lawyer until one day, as their &lt;strong&gt;neighbor&lt;/strong&gt;, he read an op-ed by one Robert Novak, informing him that his neighbor was really a CIA agent.
Just another face to the impact that Scooter and Karl had with their little game.  How anyone can continue to defend them is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Sheep in Wolf (Blitzer's) Clothing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Who told Wolf Blitzer that he was a hard hitting journalist?  His interview this afternoon of Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez was full of weighted questions with zero, nada, zilch follow-up.  On the surface, the question seemed legitimate, however, after the canned response (obviously the questions had been vetted), &lt;em&gt;Wolf&lt;/em&gt; simply took Gonzalez‚Äôs answer and moved on to the next lolipop question.  At least Russert and Mathews push a little further with the question before moving on.  A good read on the subject, IMO, is Katrina Vanden Huevel‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?bid=7&amp;amp;pid=4659&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on Bob Costas, of all people, filling in for another softy, Larry King.  It makes me laugh when righties call CNN a ‚Äúleft-wing media organization‚Äù.  What does that make Katrina and her magazine &lt;em&gt;The Nation&lt;/em&gt;?  A revolutionary media organization?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A New Goal?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So CNN has this feature in their afternoon politics show, where these two chicks are surfin‚Äô the web for blogs and what‚Äôs being discussed about the current events.  So I realize all they are really doing is searching Technorati for keywords. And though I know Technorati pulls categories as tags, a politics rant may not show up in a search about Tom DeLay.  Thus, I installed a tag generator for the site (via a &lt;a href=&quot;http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-keywords&quot;&gt;WordPress plugin, Jerome‚Äôs keywords&lt;/a&gt;) so that I can start adding tags to my posts, and possibly get some hotty on CNN to read my post on air.  Is that not the most geeky thing to strive for?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Does Bush Ever Listen to What He Says?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôm sitting here working, listening to CNN in the background, and the President is doing a press conference with the Prime Minister of Australia, and they open the floor to questions.  Obviously, the two pressing issues that arise are the Supreme Court and the ‚ÄúLeak‚Äù.  First question is about the Supreme Court, and whether or not it‚Äôs important to name a woman to replace O‚ÄôConnor.  So, he stumbles around, as usual, and then says this doozy, ‚Äú I want to be known as the kind of person who does what he says he‚Äôs going to do‚Ä¶‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050719.html&quot;&gt;Link to transcript of press conference&lt;/a&gt;.
Now, concerning the ‚ÄúLeak‚Äù, didn‚Äôt he say that if anyone that was involved worked in  the White House, they‚Äôd be fired? And hasn‚Äôt he basically recanted that statement in the last few days? So, Mr. President, which is it going to be, a ‚Äúperson who does what he says he‚Äôs going to do‚Äù, or a person who does what he‚Äôs told to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for a funny little read on Rove,  check out ‚ÄúPerfect project: Rove deserves a Rove makeover‚Äù at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/12165077.htm&quot;&gt;Miami Herald &lt;/a&gt; (note, it is a subscription site, so you may want to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bugmenot.com/view.php?url=www.miamiherald.com&quot;&gt;Bugmenot&lt;/a&gt; and get a login.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jon Stewart Has it Right,Again</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I despise the Rove machine, and all it stands for.  Which really however, is the root of what Jon Stewart said this evening about the Rove/Plame ‚Äúscandal‚Äù, and that is, it‚Äôs not really about legality issue, its just another example of how this administration on the surface says and does one thing (see videotapes of Rove being interviewed, denying any involvement at all, McClellan vehemently denying any White House involvement, Bush‚Äôs statement about firing leaks), then under the surface the White House was involved, Rove did have a hand in it, and  Bush has  no intention of firing, not to mention even distancing himself from those involved (see the smirk on Rove‚Äôs face today exiting Air Force One with Bush).  All the allegations of back room deals, war for oil, all come rushing to the surface when situations such as this occur.  The logical conclusion has to be that if they are capable of lies about outing a CIA agent, or if not out right outing (we still don‚Äôt know who the first Novak source is) then why wouldn‚Äôt someone believe that Cheney really did have closed door meeting with the  energy companies, or that the administration really did have a plan before 9.11 to invade Iraq, and that contracts with Halliburton were already in place?  As the old saying goes, where there‚Äôs smoke, there‚Äôs fire.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Frog March, Witch Hunt, or Much Ado About Nothing?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The national media had to latch onto the Rove story.  No matter how many other global events occurred- hurricanes, bombings, pregnant no-talent bleach blondes attending film premiers- the story just didn‚Äôt go away.  The question now is, what will come of it.  Already, the lead talking heads from the Dem‚Äôs camp are posturing; Henry ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs call an investigation at the drop of a dime‚Äù Waxman, Harry Reid (who actually has had the most reasonable response I‚Äôve read from the ‚Äúleft‚Äù) and now I‚Äôm hearing even good ol‚Äô Kerry is waking up from the nap he‚Äôs been taking since last fall.  But will all the clamoring, all the rankle, simply be spun as being a witch hunt, or will the Dem‚Äôs do the smart thing, and stand back, and give Bush and his boys enough rope to hang themselves?
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinylittledots.com&quot;&gt;Tiny Little Dots&lt;/a&gt; discusses the media growing a pair, and one would hope that considering the ramifications the case has had on how journalists will be able to do their job, I for one, expect them to take to task the red meat this story is exposing.  But if the ‚Äúfrog march‚Äù that Joe Wilson first spoke of is to happen, the patient persistence of the media and left is the only way to let middle America take hold of this, and only then will Bush and co. be forced to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chief Justice O'Connor?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So it seems with all the speculations in Washington on whether or not Rehnquist will step down, and how Bush is going to stack the court for years to come with conservative judges, the angle is being played that if  he does step down for health reasons, that O‚ÄôConnor should be nominated for the Chief Justice position. &lt;!---more--&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nytimes.com/2005/07/11/politics/politicsspecial1/11court.html&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reports that a conversation was had between some senators and Justice O‚ÄôConnor on the very subject and that she said she was ‚Äúflattered‚Äù and that she didn‚Äôt say no.  I find it an interesting move, as she‚Äôs been lauded by both sides since her resignation, and find it hard to believe that Bush would be able o escape public opinion on the matter.  If she were nominated, it would be a slam dunk conformation, and if she wasn‚Äôt nominated, the Republicans would be painted in a light that perhaps the dems could pull more seats in Congress in ‚Äò06.  I wonder what pressure there is now on Rehnquist to stick it out as long as possible,  when just days before the hope was that he‚Äôd step down?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emusic Affiliate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick advertisement (did I say that on a personal blog), but I so highly recommend this site for such a long time, that I have no problems advertising it along with personally subscribing to it.  Labels like Merge, Matador, Bloodshot, 4AD, not to mention Jade Tree and Polyvinyl.  All done in VBR Mp3 format.  Consider Itunes is $.99 a track, the basic plan offers 40 tracks a month for just $9.99.  You do the math.  Best part is they offer a free trial of 50 downloads, so you can‚Äôt go wrong (and I get a kick back for every trial, so help me pay for my hosting while you fill in that back catalog of the Pixies, Pavement, and check out the new album from Daniel Lanois)&lt;/p&gt;
