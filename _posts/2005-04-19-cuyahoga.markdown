Perhaps all the partisan back room back slapping is finally biting the Republicans in the ass.  I found this quote from <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/04/19/national/w173550D01.DTL">Senator Voinovich of Ohio</a>
<blockquote>"I think one's <b>interpersonal skills</b> and their relationship with their fellow man is a very important ingredient in anyone that works for me. I call it the kitchen test. Do we feel comfortable about the kitchen test?"</blockquote> 
Senator Voinovich broke rank today, giving the Dems a nod at being non partisan in their disagreement of President Bush's nomination of John Bolton for UN ambassador.  Voinovich believes serious questions have been raised, and spoke up.  He was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aTmkqNaVxX1k&refer=us">quoted </a> as saying
<blockquote>
"There was enough brought out here that caused me some real concerns'' about Bolton's <b>`interpersonal skills,</b>'' </blockquote>
  What his honesty did, was give Chuck Hagel the hutzpah to continue to question Bolton's nomination, and actually say he's not sure he would vote on the floor for the nomination.  Thank you, Senators.
