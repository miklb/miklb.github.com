As I age, and my path this time around grows longer, it bewilders me the dynamics that occur between us humans.  Even as "life" continues to get in the way, and forks appear at every turn, people still continue to cross my path.  Such was my evening.  A last minute call, a ticket to a hockey game, and two men I'm proud to call acquaintances, nonetheless friends, produced a profound feeling.
  A few more forks in the evening (not to mention a couple of High Lifes and Jagers), and I was faced with another question of what being a friend was.
However, I can say without a doubt that the two men that I was privileged to accompany to the hockey game have routinely given me reason to check myself, without any overt actions.  To me, that,  camaraderie aside, is the true nature of friendship.  
Thanks guys.
