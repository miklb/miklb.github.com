    <p>If you made it this far, then the dns have populated, and you are viewing the site on the new server.  My hosting was about to be up, not to mention I was having trouble with the old host, in the sense they didn’t seem to care if I renewed, especially in regards to the manner they handled the last two tickets I opened.  I understand things happen, but don’t treat me like a child or idiot.<br />
More about the new hosting later, anyway, pardon the dust, and the half done look.  I need to get the rest of the site back up, meaning the cooking and my sandbox.  After that, some TLC to the home office. I did manage to finally update to 2.0, and the only problem so far seems to be a conflict with an RSS plugin and the built in magpie RSS for Squible (which might get the door, we’ll see).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I just couldn’t take Squible anymore.  It’s a great theme, and there are aspects I do like, it’s just not me.  So I’m adapting a design I’ve been working on for something else for the time being, and will continue to tweak over the next few days.  I hope it doesn’t interupt anyone’s viewing of the more popular posts.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-franken/reflections-on-the-wellst_b_15459.html?">Al Franken over at HuffPo</a> sets the record straight regarding the Wellstone Memorial, especially in comparison to the King Service.  A point he touches on, that the conservative pundits have failed to, regarding Carter’s comments, is that Carter knew Coretta Scott King.  Recently, while watching Carter on Larry King, he remarked that he probably wouldn’t have been president had it not been for King.  He said she campaigned strongly for him in ‘76.  It just burns the Republicans that he’s still out there in the world, making things happen, and they’re busy putting out Abramhoff and Libby fires.</p>

    <p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060208/ap_on_go_co/delay_appropriations;_ylt=AkPc7IcFEINjwxZdiLuRqfqs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3OXIzMDMzBHNlYwM3MDM-">AP (via Yahoo)</a>  So, the old Hammer slips in shit and comes out smelling like a rose.  He’s been handed a “coveted” seat on the Appropriations Committee, and get this, a seat on the sub-committee overseeing the Justice Department.  Which, just so happens to be who is investigating the Abramhoff scandal.  And while he’s at it, he got a seat overseeing NASA (the same NASA that was recently revealed to have a political appointee of Bush’s who’s been censoring its scientists on global warming, that <a href="http://scientificactivist.blogspot.com/2006/02/breaking-news-george-deutsch-did-not.html">doesn’t have a completed college degree</a> and regardless of his studies, his major was journalism).  Anyway, back to DeLay, go figure, he’s up for reelection, and now sits on the NASA subcommittee, and guess what, his home district just happens to be Houston, home of Johnson Space Center.  So anyone with half a brain can tell you that was as politically motivated an appointment as they get, and despite what anyone says, the Republicans are going about dirty business as usual.</p>
