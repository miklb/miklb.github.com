So I started the WordPress "fan" site recently, <a href="http://wpstation.com">WordPress Station</a>, and recently got it its own domain.  And while surfing around, I found an open source design that was a hack of Apple's brushed metal design.  There was a brushed metal theme for WP when I first started using it, but it's disappeared.  Not sure why, but I figured there might be a few who'd want to give it a run.  Therefore, I'm in the process of porting it to WP, and have it in "beta" over at WPstation.  Plus, I've been busy working with an upstart hosting company, and will begin offering a great deal on a basic hosting package VERY soon.
Now if I could only motivate myself to post over at cookingwith more...
