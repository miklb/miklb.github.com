          <div class="e-content">
            <p>Perhaps today’s Tunesday was inspired by the plethora of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nekocase">tweets</a> I’ve seen from her the past few days (to <a href="http://www.nekocase.com/auction/index.htm">raise money to help students with creative writing</a>), coupled with a beautiful woman I recently met giving me “bonus points” for liking Neko Case. Or it’s just that I love Neko Case’s voice.</p>
            <p>I’ve had a love affair with her voice for about 8 years, since I first heard <cite>Porchlight</cite> from the soundtrack to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266971/">Slaughter Rule</a>.</p>
            <p>At the time, I was working 100hr weeks, and rarely had time to find music outside of emusic.com, but I was able to get my hands on <cite>Furnace Room Lullaby</cite>.  And while I didn’t race out to buy more of her music, I often came back to that album.  A couple of years later <cite>Fox Confessor Brings the Flood</cite> was released, and if I wasn’t smitten (mind you, I’d probably never even seen her photo, it was purely the soul and emotion of her voice, not some school boy crush on a pretty face - though I now know that’s the case too).</p>
            <p><cite>Margaret vs Pauline</cite> immediately joined my heavy rotation list, and is still on one of my favorite play lists.  Since then I’ve acquired <cite>The Virginian</cite>, an earlier recording, as well as what I think is her latest recording, <cite>Middle Cyclone</cite>.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, by the time i discovered she was playing in Orlando a little over a year ago, the show was sold out.  I’m anxiously awaiting the next opportunity, in the meantime I leave you with <cite>Star Witness</cite> off of <cite>Fox Confessor Brings the Flood</cite>, from the aforementioned sold out show in Orlando, Florida December of ‘09.</p>

            <p>In case you’ve been lost in all of the SXSWi hullabaloo, or just neck deep in work like myself, it seems the W3C HTML Working Group has <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011Mar/0245.html">decided</a> using role=presentation on a table element is now conforming.  So it seems after 5 years of fighting this out in the trenches, per one  rebuttal to the proposal:</p>
            <blockquote>Over the past decade or more, Web designers have been moving away from tables for layout. For a while, limitations in the market leading Web browser made this somewhat impractical for sites with complicated flexible layouts that had to be compatible with a broad range of user agents, but this is no longer the case, and new sites can avoid using tables without difficulty. Old sites won't change, but old sites are not affected by changes to conformance criteria, since they already exist. Conformance criteria only affect actively developed sites, and those can move away from tables (and many avoid using tables at all).
            </blockquote>
            <p>The counter argument from the working group:</p>
            <blockquote>
              This assertion does not mention a specific example. By contrast the authors of the proposal to make <code>
                <table role="presention"> conforming cite gmail, facebook, yahoo mail, numerous IBM applications, and toolkits such as DOJO and YUI. As each of these are actively maintained, we find that there was insufficient evidence provided to back up this assertion.

So Facebook prevails (again)?  God help us all.

            <p>I  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36112884@N07/3787346825/" title="Birthday Cake by Im a terrible photographer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2640/3787346825_57a6001c20.jpg" class="right" width="500" height="333" alt="Birthday Cake" /></a>knew it was right around this time, but it seems that this little slice of the web turned 6 this weekend, as did my twisting adventure of making a living building web sites.  Seems like yesterday still I was purchasing my first tiny plan from A Small Orange and installing WordPress 1.2.  Now I have 2 different VPS’s, manage 100’s of WordPress sites for work on a dedicated server (<em>managed</em>, I’m not that much a masochist), and moved onto Habari for my personal sites.  Ironically or not, those that started Habari were some of the very ones that welcomed me into WordPress and were the ones that probably have helped me the most to get where I’ve gotten today.</p>
            <p>So I’d like to share this virtual cake particularly with <a href="http://chrisjdavis.org/">Chis J Davis</a>, as the first theme I tore apart to customize was one of his (among many others down the road), <a href="http://asymptomatic.net/">Owen Winkler</a> for the many plugins I used to get started as well as the many hours of tutelage over the years on a variety of subjects, and <a href="http://skippy.net/">Scott Merrill</a>, because in addition to his many plugins and welcoming nature, his patience in helping walk me through setting up my first VPS.</p>
            <p>There are many, many more who’ve helped me through these past six years I couldn’t begin to name them all, but please know I’m eternally grateful to each and every one.</p>

              Towards a Responsive Design

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>I am not sure I had really paid attention to the term <em>responsive design</em> when I started the redesign for this site. I just knew I wanted something that would be as readable on an iPhone as it was on my large desktop monitor.  I made some conscious decisions to remove a bunch of extraneous elements not for the mobile viewing, but I simply wanted to focus attention on what ever it was I was writing about.  Sidebars full of links, tweets, buttons and badges might have been novel 6 years ago when I started this site, but not so important to me now.</p>
            <p>I also wanted to learn more about HTML5 and CSS3.  For my own site, I’m completely not interested in supporting old browsers, save for using a HTML5 polyfill for &lt; IE 9.  If someone is using IE 6, they probably don’t have much interest in what I’m sharing anyway.  So I played with some max-widths and widths based on percentage until I found something that worked for me.  Perhaps that’s not the best way to approach it, as the site really should be about those visiting, but I guess <span class="pquote-r">I made an assumption my browsers/screen resolutions/mobile devices were common enough that if it looked OK to me, it should look OK to visitors.</span>  Up until today, I was fairly happy with what I had come up with, save for the Youtube videos I’ve been posting.  I have been experimenting with using the HTML5 iframe wrapper Youtube offers, and choosing a very large version of the video.  Which wasn’t working out for smaller screens.</p>
            <p>But as I’m studying more about the advanced concepts of responsive design and using media queries, I ran across Ethan Marcotte’s <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images/">fluid images</a> post.  Lo and behold, I set &lt;pre&gt;<code>iframe {max-width: 100%}</code>&lt;/pre&gt; and my video posts scale along with the surrounding content.</p>
            <p>I’m not sure I will mess with this site anytime soon code or design wise, but I do intend to experiment with using the <a href="http://lessframework.com/">Less Framework</a> and possibly the intriguing <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_images_experimenting_with_context_aware_image_sizing/">context aware responsive images</a> script over on my <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking site</a>, which is a blueprint based grid design spun off of the markup of this site.  I don’t think it would take much to convert the grid to the Less Framework.  I may think about a design that’s not quite as similar to this in the process.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the direction, I’d like to thank Kevin Zurawel for his <a href="http://arborwebsolutions.com/2011/03/wordcamp-miami-2011/">WordCamp Miami session on responsive design</a> and piquing my interest on the subject even more.</p>

            <p>I finally got around to setting up <a href="http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/">Tweet Nest</a> at <a href="http://tweets.miklb.com">http://tweets.miklb.com</a>, to archive, well, my tweets.  Seems Twitter only goes back so far, so I don’t have <strong>all</strong> of them, but I think I have an archive somewhere that does. May look at figuring out how to add those in at some point.  Tweet Nest is a very cool little open source app.</p>
