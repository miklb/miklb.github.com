Here it is almost December and it’s finally becoming a legitimate news.  Some of my favoriates, DeLay’s wife was paid over 3 grand a month to determine each Congrress man’s favorite charity.  One would assume that could be done by a few low level staffers in a week via  email and voice calls.  And it looks more and more like DeLay is going to be smack dab in the middle of this one too.  While we’re at it, might someone look a little further into the Brian Darling connection as well.  With Bill Nelson facing a tough election next year, this could be something to take another swipe out of the Republican machine.</p>

                  Scanlon also admitted… he, Lobbyist A, and others engaged in a pattern of bribery through which one or both of them offered and provided a stream of things of value to public officials, including trips, campaign contributions, meals and entertainment in exchange for agreements that public officials would use their official positions and influence to benefit the clients of Scanlon and Lobbyist A as well as Lobbyist A’s businesses.</p>
                <p>So Michael Scanlon, former DeLay aide, has pleaded guilty in a deal to agree to testify against Abramhoff.  Does this mean he has some dirt on DeLay as well?  Only time will tell.  I’m sure the Justice dept is licking its lips at this one!</p>
