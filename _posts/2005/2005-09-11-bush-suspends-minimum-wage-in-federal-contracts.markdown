<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050908-5.html">Proclamation</a> Apparently, there's provisions that state the Labor Secretary sets a minumum wage to pay various levels of laborers and "mechanics".  Well, Bush has suspended this provision.   It's written into the provision that he can, and in some circumstances, I can understand why.  But we are talking about Bush, and Cheney, and I can see how some corporate contractors seize an opportunity to not pay laborers a federally mandated min. rate, but still charge their "normal" fees.  So prior to the Hurricane, a skilled worker in NO would have been paid a certain rate if working on a federal contract, now he will be paid less.  Good thing those tax cuts went to those who needed it most...
