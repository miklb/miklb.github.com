    <meta name="description" content="9rules Network has announced 111 new sites for the network.  111!?  Before I go any further, let me say, that I’m not some bitter blogger that was part of the 589 bloggers that were rejected.  I would never consider this blog something for a network.  I don’t have a niche, I don’t post enough, I simply rant out loud, and a few people actually read it.  Period. But as someone who reads a lot of sites, I once took a site’s acceptance into 9rules as some sort of validation, that perhaps before reading a post, there was a strong chance that the author was going to know what they were talking about, or that the information would indeed be valid.  But to water down the network, IMO, with that many blogs in one fell swoop, I can’t help but believe it was a publicity stunt for a group that had recently fallen off the radar, so to speak.I mean, what better way to get the blogosphere to chatter about you than to “accept” 111 sites into the network.  How much traffic directly from those sites is generated alone?  Plus those, (I guess I’m buying into the hype by posting this) who comment on the recent events.  I must say, I really have a hard time buying any of this, and will now take the 9rules logo on a site with a grain of salt, and that is an injustice to those who have been longer termed members of the network.I’d like to say I haven’t looked at all 111 sites, and I’m sure they are all fine bloggers in their own right.  I simply have a hard time understanding how that many are brought in at once.I think I might create a snazzy little logo and start my own network.  I’m sure at least 100 of those 589 that were not admitted are as good in their own right as the 111 picked.  It could be called the Odd Man Out Network.  Wonder how much ad revenue that would generate?  Anyone interested in joining?" />
