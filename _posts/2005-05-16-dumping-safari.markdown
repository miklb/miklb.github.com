I think I have finally dumped Safari, as my browser of choice.  Granted , it took finding a theme for Firefox that mimicks Safari's brushed metal look, found here--><a href="http://temporaer.net/open/themes/brushed.php">http://temporaer.net/open/themes/brushed.php</a>

A few extensions have also intrigued me.  The only draw back, is I can't take care of the built in spell check found in Safari.  Perhaps there's an extension for that as well.  I'll take a look.
Not to mention, certain things just render better in Firefox.  I'm sure I'll still use Safari, just not for day to day browsing, and definitely not for blogging.
