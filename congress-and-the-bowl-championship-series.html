But this is that last place Congress needs to be sticking their nose.  With record deficits, a war, corruption all over the Republican map, and this is best they’ve got.  Flabergasted, that’s all I’ve got to say. I wonder if this guy Barton is one of the ones the Texas jerrymandering case got elected?" />
