        <p><a href="http://www.votejan.com/">Jan Schneider for Congress</a>Just a note to any readers in  Congressional district 13, to support Jan Schneider in her attempt to take the seat vacated by Katherine Harris.  I’ve gotten several emails pushing for her support, and come across a couple of blog posts as well, so I took a minute to check out her credentials.  Not your soccer mom got bored, or super rich white girl with nothing better to do type of candidate.  It’s also my understanding that a recent Democrat convert is being supported by the DNC.  I hope that’s not the case, and all because one may have a few more dollars than the other.  Shame shame.</p>

<p>I’d love to know more about this one, so if you have any details, do share.</p>

        <p>So, just over a year ago I started blogging.  I believe I’ve grown quite a bit in my web knowledge in a short time of actually using a site I’ve started.  I tried doing something with just about every free resource out there, it just never “took”.  It wasn’t until my friend over at <a href="http://www.tinylittledots.com">tiny little dots</a> adopted WordPress, and thus I installed it on my newly purchased domain, did the light go on.  At once I felt at home.  I immediately begin cramming massive amounts of CSS knowledge into my already crowded head. I now can I say I can see myself actually putting food on the table and a roof over my head some day doing this stuff full time.  I’ve got a long way to go, and need to particularly see where I “fit in”, but it is quite exciting, a feeling I lost quite some time ago in regards to cooking.</p>

<p>So a hardy thank you to tiny for adopting WP and to <a href="http://www.7milesdown.com/wp/">trench</a> for my first blogroll link.  Also a big thanks to the many people who’ve stopped by and left a comment, it’s always nice to know someones reading the site :)</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to seeing what the next year of doing this brings, what direction things will go, but if the first was any indication, it’s going to be great.</p>

        <p>A last minute entry into <a href="http://www,freemacware.com">freemacware.com’s</a> contest, listing your 5 most favored freeware apps.  Their list is quite extensive, and I’ve found several apps I didn’t know about, but for the most part, these are the ones I use day in and day out. (I can’t say these are in any particular order)</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/cyberduck">Cyberduck</a> - a super great FTP client, that works hand in hand with several text editors and CSS Edit to allow editing files directly on the server</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/smultron">Smultron</a> - my text editor of choice.  As noted, it works flawlessly with Cyberduck</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/growl">Growl</a> - A sytem wide notification app, that works with numerous apps, including cyberduck to notify you when a file's been up/down loaded, in itunes when a new song plays, can set up a gmail or mail notifier, and numerous other apps all with an unobtrusive faded in box in the upper right corner</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/adium">Adium</a> - my IM app of choice.  I don't do IM with a lot of different people, however, I do a lot of work with people all of the world, so having AOL, yahoo and gtalk all in the same app makes it quite easy to connect with a client in their IM of choice</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/voodoopad-lite">VooDoo Pad lite</a> - A fantastic note app, that works like a little wiki right on your desktop.  I really love how I can make a table of contents type page, and then create "links" to new pages.  I can really simply, and quickly organize a project this way.  Also supports drag and drop functionality too, so I can drag an image to a page, a link generally anything.  I've seriously thought about purchasing the "pro" version, or what ever they call it, simply because I use the app so much.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other apps I use/recommend are obviously <a href="http://www.freemacware.com/firefox">firefox</a>, as well as<a href="http://www.freemacware.com/vienna"> vienna</a> and <a href="http://www.freemacware.com/flickrexport">flickr export</a> an iphoto plugin that allows quick and easy sharing of your photos via <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a>.</p>

<p>If I’ve missed a great app, I’d love to know about it.</p>
