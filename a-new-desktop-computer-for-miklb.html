    <meta name="description" content="So, I’ve been toiling away for years now with outdated G3 macs, and kept hemming and hawing, waiting for the “next wave” of new Macs.  Well, I couldn’t take it any longer, and broke down and grabbed one of the new dual-core Mac Minis as I had a 17” VGA monitor for the window’s box, as well as existing USB keyboard and mouse from the old imac.  So it’s up and running, albeit I need to find someone locally who can install 3rd party ram, as I’m not paying Apple $300 for a gig stick of ram so than can install it for free.  Maybe Comp-USA?  Anyway, one thing that I noticed right off the bat was FireFox was not liking running on Rosetta, the built in conversion for older apps to the new intel processor.  So I was all but switching back to Safari, as FF was just choking.  That is, until today, when I found an “unofficial” build of the soon to be released universal binary of FF.  Sweet.  All of my extensions work with “DeerPark”, and things load as fast as they should be, no hang ups. (so far).  I’m really loving the move to Tiger as well, not to mention the shear fact of having a processor and HD meant for this century :).  I haven’t really had to time to play with any of the iLife apps, or use Front Row, but all in due time.No to start saving for when the new 17” macbook pros come out." />
