          <p>Though there are many ways to socialize on the net (too many), I recently revisited this invite only site, <a href="http://8apps.com/">8apps.</a>  They’ve added a few more apps to the planned 8, so there’s a few more things to check out.

          <p>That said, if you’d like to check it out, I’ve got 40 odd invites available, just leave a comment and I’ll be sure to send one.  Only thing I ask is that you after sign up, look me up (miklb) and add me as a contact, as the system doesn’t automatically add invites to your contact list.</p>
