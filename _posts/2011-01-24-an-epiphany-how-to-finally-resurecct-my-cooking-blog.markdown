There are probably 6 of you who know me either in real life or online who read my tweets/blog that know that A)I was a chef in another life, B) I have a cooking blog.

Every 9 months or so, I get these grand ambitions to resurrect the blog, but my grandiose visions overwhelm the realities of my daily life, and they never transpire.  That's not to say that I don't still love food, that I don't <strong>every day</strong>  in my current profession as a guy who makes and manages web sites (do they still call it webmaster?) use my experiences as a chef, both in the work place dealing with people and changing focus at the drop of a dime, as well as the art itself.  It's ephemeral, here today, gone in 20 minutes, a delicate balance between art and science.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/2658524899"><img alt="Still Life-ish" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3154/2658524899_0cc07183aa.jpg" class="right"></a>

The epiphany is, keep it simple stupid.  It may not surprise 4 of you 6 that I read weekly the Miami Herald, NY Times, Chicago Tribune, LA Times food sections as well as our local Ã¼ber cool food writer Jeff Houck.  Not to mention the many tweets and links that come through my streams weekly.  I often want to share these, with a short anecdote, or comment.  <epiphany> That's what a couple of my favorite bloggers - Gruber and Kottke - do already</epiphany>.  It was really the basis of blogging 6-7 years ago.  Then, just maybe then, I won't feel the overwhelming (self imposed) pressure to write long form. Those can just occur naturally.   

My question to the 3 of you still reading this? I should probably not push these to my regular Twitter account, right? I should just tell folks about the re-positioning once it's done, and let them subscribe to the feed. Possibly create a new Twitter account to push those updates to those who prefer to use Twitter instead of Atom feeds for updates?  Should I link directly to the source article, ala Gruber, or simply link in the post with my anecdote ala Kottke?

And full disclaimer, I do have advertising on that site, that despite it's languishing in purgatory, pays for a significant amount of my hosting costs.  That has nothing to do with my desire to kick start the site however, but just want to be clear, ads will continue on the site.
