Though there are many ways to socialize on the net (too many), I recently revisited this invite only site, <a href="http://8apps.com/">8apps.</a>  They've added a few more apps to the planned 8, so there's a few more things to check out.  Not meant as a review, as I honestly haven't spent enough time on the site to give justice, suffice to say it's a very slick site, with a lot of potential.  It's simply up against stiff competition.

That said, if you'd like to check it out, I've got 40 odd invites available, just leave a comment and I'll be sure to send one.  Only thing I ask is that you after sign up, look me up (miklb) and add me as a contact, as the system doesn't automatically add invites to your contact list.
