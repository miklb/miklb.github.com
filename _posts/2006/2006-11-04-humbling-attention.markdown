As I've had this site for a while, I've become less and less of a stats whore, but at least a few times a month I check my referrer logs.  The past month or so, I've been linked to by two separate design showcase sites.  The first, <a href="http://www.cssliquid.com/2006/gallery/miklb%e2%80%99s-mindless-ramblings/">Liquid Designs</a>, showcases sites that use liquid width design.  A lot of this site is based on that concept, and it's something I'm learning more about.  The second, and more recent is from <a href="http://www.designmeltdown.com/chapters/Blogs/Part2.aspx">Design Melt Down</a>, part of their "Beautiful Blogs" section.
I did put a lot of time into this past springs CSSReboot for the site, and have tried to maintain the site despite the lapses in content.  However I would have never expected ANY type of recognition for the work.  So to the operators of the site, and those that have clicked over, thanks.
