  <h1 class="post-title p-name">URL Shorteners, HTTP Referers and 301 Redirects</h1>
  <time datetime="2009-06-29T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">29 Jun 2009</time>
  <div class="e-content">
      <p>I’ll start by saying I don’t know much about the subject, but am posting this in the hopes that someone who does can elucidate the issue.  My basic dilemma is that I have a short bit of code on my single page templates that checks to see if a visitor is from Twitter, and if so, show a little message.  (Not an original idea, I think I saw it on a post at Smashing Magazine).  The code they used didn’t work, but with the help of <a href="http://mattread.com/">BigJibby</a> in the Habari IRC channel, I was able to get it working with Habari.</p>

<p>I more or less forgot about it, until a few people noticed it and asked if it was a plugin.  When I replied it wasn’t, they asked if I could make it into one.  So it went into a to-do list I keep of Habari related ideas.  This evening I began working on it, and while troubleshooting how to actually output something to the entry single template (that’s a whole other can of worms), I discovered the code snippet wasn’t working.  With the help of <a href="http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/">Michael</a>, we discovered the problem wasn’t with the code snippet, rather it was with the URL shorteners.  Twitter recently started defaulting to <a href="http://bit.ly">Bit.ly</a>, and I recently began experimenting with <a href="http://tr.im">Tr.im</a>,  <span class="pquote-r">both of which weren’t sending twitter.com as the referrer.  Rather, due to their 301 redirect they return <strong>NULL</strong>.  Which in a nut shell sucks. </span></p>

<p>Somehow Google Analytics is able to track referrals from Twitter, as last week when I had a huge upsurge in traffic from the popularity of the <a href="http://miklb.com/infinite-summer-bookmarks">Infinite Summer Bookmarks</a>, I’m seeing 50 visitors from Twitter the first day (of the 785, by far a record for this little weblog).</p>

<p>At this point, finishing the plugin seems moot, as the only way to be sure that visitors will actually see the message would be to use a URL shortener that doesn’t return NULL, of which, the only one we found that to not be the case was Owen’s <a href="http://pastoid.com">Pastoid</a>.  I didn’t test Tinyurl, nor was I interested in looking for others.  The disappointment had already set in.  Besides that, if you are auto posting to Twitter with a plugin, you wouldn’t have the option to use a different shortener.</p>

<p>So kind readers/stumble-uponers, if anyone has a solution to this problem, please enlighten me.  Meanwhile, I’ll work out the issue with Habari and my desire to output content on a single entry template within the content output, not above the body tag.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in the snippet of code I am using:</p>

<p><code>if ( parse_url($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], PHP_URL_HOST) == 'twitter.com' ) {
	    echo "&lt;h2 class='twittervisit'&gt;Welcome, Twitter visitor! If this post is useful, don't hesitate to retweet!&lt;/h2&gt;";
</code></p>
