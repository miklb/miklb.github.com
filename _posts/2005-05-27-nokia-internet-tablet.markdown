<img class="center" src="wp-images/770_pro.jpg" alt="nokia tablet" />An interesting device that will hit the market later this year.  The fairly unique aspect is that it is a unix based device, taking advantage of open source software, and will lend its modified os to developers.  Also interesting that Nokia doesn't highlight that aspect at its features.  Will retail around $350.  Like I said, interesting.
