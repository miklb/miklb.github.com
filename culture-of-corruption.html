    <meta property="og:title" content="“Culture of Corruption”" />
    <meta name="description" content="As some who’ve read here before, you know I’ve looked forward to this day for some time.  The only thing I look forward to more now is the day Tom DeLay is found guilty of at least some of his crimes against this country.  To me, he’s committed treason.  He’s cheated and lied to the American people, and circumvented the law, which thereby prevented the people of Texas from rightly electing their officials.  But this is all fairly main stream news.  What I’ve found more interesting is the mantra the democratic party line is using in the recent criminal charges/investigations…“culture of corruption”.  When election time rolls around in ‘06, expect that phrase to be played out over and over.  I think that will be the real “platform” for unseating the Republicans.  I think it can be used in just about every situation from the appointment of Brown to FEMA to the gerrymandering issues in Texas." />
