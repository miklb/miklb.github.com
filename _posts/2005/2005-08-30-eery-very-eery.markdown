<a href="http://www.nola.com/hurricane/?/washingaway/">NOLA.com: Hurricane Center</a>Don't ask me why, but when looking at national news, I clicked on the bookmark for the Times Picayune...A front page void of news, with some prexisting links still there, I found this 5 part series link at the bottom of the page.<blockquote> "A catastrophic hurricane represents 10 or 15 atomic bombs in terms of the energy it releases," said Joseph Suhayda, a Louisiana State University engineer who is studying ways to limit hurricane damage in the New Orleans area.</blockquote>
