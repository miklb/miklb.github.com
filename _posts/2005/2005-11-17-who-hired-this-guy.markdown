<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/17/AR2005111701879.html?nav=rss_politics">Washington Post</a> OK, sure, when ever you've got billions of dollars flowing around with out a check and balance system, there's bound to be some corruption.  Much has been made about the no-bid contracts, the mis-management of money by the Bremer lead provisional Authority, and finally formal charges have been levied.  My question is this?  Who their right mind hired this guy Stein to work their in the first place.  Talk about fox in the hen house.  Guy was found guilty of fraud in '96, spent some time in jail even.  Hello!!  He even paid some of his restitution from the previous crime with the kickbacks he got for this one.  His wife paid taxes! 3 years late!  I'd love, just love to know who he <em>knew</em> to get the job.  And I'd like to hear how it wasn't thought out on how to hire people to oversee <strong>REGIONS</strong> without proper background checks.  This wasn't a low level guy getting a few thousand dollars, this was a guy who got .5 million in kickbacks for fixing over 13 million in contracts, which never really were done.  And the investigator says 50 more are being looked at.  More examples of poor planning by the administration.  Thank God though they were able to "negotiate" the deals with Haliburton months before the invasion...
