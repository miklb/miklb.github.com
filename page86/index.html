You can read his last entry, and then in the comments, see the news.  I highly suggest reading more of entries, and look at his bio page.  That’s why I said this shit has just got to stop.</p>

                <p>Ok, so we use Netflix, and it’s great.  Even if I don’t watch a film for 2 weeks, it’s there, and I don’t feel too guilty for only watching 3-4 films in a month, it still only costs the $18, roughly.  Anyway, just saw a commercial for &lt;a http://www.gamefly.com”&gt;Game Fly&lt;/a&gt;, a Netflix clone for video games. 2 games at a time for $21.95.  Certainly would beat dropping $50 to find out a game flat out sucks, and try and dump it on ebay for $30, to try and recoup your lost.  Will let you know how it works.</p>

                <p>So with the ever growing trend in cable news to simply discuss missing boyfriends of washed up pop stars, and missing 18 year olds, I’ve found myself looking for something else to have on in the background.  Enter current.tv or as the info on the cable says, google current.  We all heard about it, Al Gore, blah blah, <em>insert created Internet joke here</em>.  But it’s not bad.  Most of what I’ve seen is “viewer created” shorts.  Nothing has been “bad”, and some of it has been poignant.  Certainly beats Fox News, or should I say, “Jennifer Holloway, 24/7”.  What was Jon Stewart saying the other night, 14 Americans died in Iraq, and Fox still ran Van Sustren and the Holloway story.
Right now they are showing the top 10 Clicked News Stories, and how ironic, the #1 story was “Newton’s Partner seen alive”…</p>

                <p>When things are going good, they are really good.  I can’t say a bad thing about my life right now, looking forward to my classes, have a great paying job lined up that starts in a month, doing some cool stuff on the web, just over all good.  So my printer went out.  An Epson 5400 all-in-one.  Bought it about 16 months ago for $130 after rebates.  But we bought the 2 year warranty.  So, I go to trade it in today, and obviously the 5400 is an older model.  They’ve got the 6600.  Ok, they credit me the $150, the 6600 is $189 after instant rebate.  Eh, $39 isn’t bad.  But wait.  There are some mail in rebates.  How much you ask.  $110 worth!!!  So, I pay $80 out of my pocket today, will get $110 back within 6 weeks, have a brand new printer, and a 2 year no questions asked warranty.  Sweet!
Even without the trade in deal, you can get that printer for $79 through the 26th of August at CompUSA.  Still not a bad deal.</p>
