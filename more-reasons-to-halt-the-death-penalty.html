While in college, I wrote an argumentative paper against capital punishment, and I still stand by that stance.  I don’t believe those convicted of murder should live in the lap of luxury, however I don’t believe we’ve perfected a system to take another’s life in response to murder.  This article from the Columbus Dispatch details failure in the actual lethal injection process, in which failure to establish an IV led to a prolonged process, that had to be done behind closed doors.In this NY Times article, short comings in the state of Texas’s method of reviewing deaths by arson.  Currently in Texas, the reviews are made by people who’ve never attended any formal training in the area.  The article outlines the execution of an innocent man due to the process.So mistakes a plenty, no empirical evidence that the death penalty prevents murders, and mountains of tax dollars spent to litigate death penalty cases, can we end this archaic practice now?" />
