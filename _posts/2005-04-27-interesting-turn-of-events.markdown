It seems the GOP leadership in the House has agreed to revert the Ethics committee rules to the previous set.  The consensus is that they made the switch to take the wind out of the Democratic sails, thinking that the Democrats had politicized the situation so well, that it would carry into the '06 elections.  They've also tried to drag some Democrats and their travel history into the story, however so far, nothing is sticking.  Now if they can get this process to function properly, then the story can get some legs, and all the accusations can actually be vetted, and a conclusion can be found.  It's interesting though that DeLay has already started laying the ground work for a defense, claiming the travel rules are ambiguous.  How convenient.  It will take a few weeks to get the committee staffed, which already has its own set of issues, and then at some point, formal investigations can begin.  Stay tuned.
