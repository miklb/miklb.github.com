  <h1 class="post-title p-name">Nokia e62 and the Mac</h1>
  <time datetime="2007-08-26T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">26 Aug 2007</time>
  <div class="e-content">

      <p>Recently, a friend with a slightly larger budget than I, bought an iPhone.  Subsequently, they gave me their “old” Nokia e62. I’ve been a big fan of Nokia, simply because most of their phones that I’ve owned were well constructed, worked well with Cingular, and, just <em>worked</em>.</p>

<p>So quickly I discovered I can now sync my address book and iCal with the phone, which is nice.  I then sought as many means as possible to use the phone with my mac.  One downfall with Nokia, is they do not have a native Mac desktop interface, as they do with PC, but at least they’ve recently added a <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4423135">Media Manager</a>, which allows for the addition of a folder in iTunes and iPhoto , in which anything added to that folder is added to your phone.  I won’t be using the phone much for these purposes, but it’s a nice addition.  Perhaps I can see myself using it for taking a podcast or two with me for listening to while out and about.</p>

<p>Another, not so familiar utility, is the Bluetooth File Exchange application in the Utilities folder.  When I was given the phone, I didn’t get a USB data transfer cable, so I was having difficulty adding applications to the phone.  One in particular, was a fix for sending SMS messages.  They were taking forever to send.  After discovering the File Exchange app however, I was able to navigate to the file on the harddrive, send it to device, chose the phone, and the app showed up as a text message.  Opening the application allowed me to easily install apps or add new themes (even with the new phone, I’m still suffering from iPhone envy, so I found an iPhone theme, which I actually like much better than the default theme, or any of the other included themes on the phone).</p>
