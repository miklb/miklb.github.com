        <p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KYgjpL1TYxQ/SWr-EtMxm0I/AAAAAAAABV4/BqkqrCsiusA/s1600-h/Beard-Web3.jpg"><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/beardrevue.jpg" alt="beard poster" class="right" /></a>Last week I came across an interesting site, <a href="http://www.beardrevue.com/2008/01/beard-poster.html">Beard Revue</a>, and for the site’s 1 year anniversary, the author had created a print based on the classic <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=milton+glaser+bob+dylan">Milton Glaser <cite>Dylan</cite> print.</a>  Something about the print <em>spoke to me</em>.  Maybe I was caught in a melancholy mood thinking about my father, and how significant his beard was to me.  I’m not sure, but I ordered the print in one of those 2am browsing the web moments. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3222992778"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3222992778_f18e159065_s.jpg" class="left" /></a> I got an email from the author middle of the week saying the print had been shipped, and low and behold, today it arrived in the mail.  I’d like to start buying more original art like this.   I’ve been keeping my eye on <a href="http://20x200.com">20x200</a> for something to capture me, but a site with larger, affordable prints such as the beard revue would be a great find.  There’s something about opening the tube and smelling the ink that creates a much more personal connection to the artist.  I’d also add the little touch of using stamps on the tube also lends a personal touch, particularly in this case, where several different stamps are used.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you are a beard aficionado, you definitely want to check out Michael’s blog.</p>

        iPhone and Video Recording

    <time datetime="2009-01-21T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">21 Jan 2009</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p>While attending the <a href="http://miklb.com/tampa-mosi-tweetup">Tampa Tweetup</a>, I bumped into <a href="http://www.sarahintampa.com/">Sarah</a>, and she pitched me on the virtues of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_you_have_to_jailbreak_the_iphone.php"> why I should jailbreak my iPhone</a>.</p>

<p>The main selling point: <strong>recording video</strong>.</p>

<p>All of the other stuff she pointed out, Google Reader syncing, tethering, custom themes, simply didn’t appeal to me. However, recording video sounded fun, all the while perplexing as to why Apple wouldn’t have a native app by now.  Anyway, I followed the links in the aforementioned ReadWriteWeb article she posted, and (with a bit of trepidation and guilt mind you), jail broke my phone for the sake of science - see, that sounds better and helps me sleep at night :-P.</p>

<p>As I expected, none of the other selling points passed muster in my brief exploration, and the initial video recording was minimal, yet still intriguing.  I held off on restoring the phone to further test video.  Then Monday, I saw a post on TechCrunch about a sanctioned<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/16/ustream-may-be-first-to-broadcast-video-from-unhacked-iphone/"> app from Ustream</a> that allegedly would allow “users record and broadcast live video from the device”.  Certainly I was skeptical, as why would Ustream get through the Apple App Store police, but not <a href="xhttp://www.qik.com/">Qik</a>.  Maybe quality of code, manner in which the app tapped into the built in functions, it had to be <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, there were doubts that Ustream would be released in time for the inauguration, but alas, it was released on Monday at some point.  All through this, I wasn’t in any hurry to grab it, as I wasn’t expecting to be anywhere that streaming live video would have any consequence, unless you wanted to see me bring my plants in from the predicted freezing weather here in Tampa.  That was until late Tuesday I was reminded Alejandro Escovedo was playing here in town.</p>

<p>I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to test live, streaming video from an iPhone, albeit without an audience.  I registered with Ustream, downloaded teh app, and headed off to the show.  Upon arrival, I immediately realized that the released version I got only supported watching streaming video, not recording, at least I couldn’t find the option.</p>

<p>I hadn’t downloaded Qik, nor registered with the service, so as Alejandro and his band kicked it off, I grabbed the jailbroken app and registered via the phone.</p>

<p>I recorded (and I assume streamed live) several songs during the evening.</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,115,0" width="425" height="319" id="qikPlayer" align="middle"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="movie" value="http://qik.com/swfs/qikPlayer4.swf" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#333333" /><param name="FlashVars" value="rssURL=http://qik.com/video/7ff6104c73e042618403029251670abf.rss&amp;autoPlay=false" /><embed src="http://qik.com/swfs/qikPlayer4.swf" quality="high" bgcolor="#333333" width="425" height="319" name="qikPlayer" align="middle" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" flashvars="rssURL=http://qik.com/video/7ff6104c73e042618403029251670abf.rss&amp;autoPlay=false" /></object>

<p>In short, the audio quality is horrible, which most likely is the result of being right in front of the amps and the volume being maxed out on the phone, but indeed  I recorded some <a href="http://qik.com/miklb">video that went straight to the web</a>.  Not wanting to compromise the enjoyment of seeing live music, I didn’t explore all of the options in the iPhone app, I titled, tagged, and described the clips once I got home, not much unlike how I’ve done some of the pics I’ve taken and sent to my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/miklb/sets/72157612195223156/">Flickr account</a>.</p>

<p>All said and done, considering the fact I’d never logged into or looked at Qik prior to the opening of the show, I’d say that the service has promise, especially if I can follow up on some tips on recording via the phone.  Ultimately, I expect Apple to release an app that works directly with iMovie, and then allow 3rd party services to tie into that.  Until that time comes, Qik is an intriguing option,  and worth the effort to jailbreak the phone, assuming one knows the caveats that go along with doing such.</p>

        Tunesday: The Gourds

    <div class="e-content">
        <p>Today I bring the first installment of an idea I had, Tunesday.  Get it, Tuesday + tunes = Tunesday?  OK, not the most ingenious idea I’ve ever had, but since getting my iPhone, I’ve been listening to a lot more music since it’s always with me.  And subsequently, I thought it’d be nice to feature some of my favorite bands, as a nice little break for anyone who wanders through, or follows me on Twitter.</p>

<p>First up in the installment is <a href="http://www.thegourds.com">The Gourds</a>.  One of my all time favorite bands, especially live, I thought it would be appropriate to feature them as they’ve got a new album out, <cite>Haymaker!</cite>.</p>

<p>The Gourds hail from Austin, TX, and for the casual listener, might characterize them as <em>country</em>, however their sound is definitely more than that, despite the types of instruments they play.  (Ironically enough, I’ve chosen an in store performance of a new track, <cite>Country Love</cite> to feature from YouTube).</p>

<p>I would simply characterize their sound as “feel good”, albeit with a definite Alt-Country/Americana bend.</p>

<p>I was first turned onto the Gourds about 10 years ago by my friend Sandy.  Soon there after, I found a copy of their second album, <cite>Stadium Blitzer</cite> in a thrift store of all places, but it wasn’t until she started working at <a href="http://www.munichrecords.com/">Munich Records</a> and gave me a copy of <cite>Bolsa de Agua</cite> that I really saw the light.  I must have played that album straight through 5 times that first night.<cite>  Hallelujah Shine</cite> is still one of my all time favorite songs.</p>

<p>Since then, through the beauty of <a href="http://emusic.com">Emusic</a> and Munich Records, I’ve been able to collect all of their albums, and each has been a treat to listen to.  That said, their aforementioned release, <cite>Haymaker!</cite> is their best since <cite>Bolsa de Agua</cite> in my opinion.</p>

<p>If you’d like a invite to emusic for a trial membership and 50 free downloads (you’ll have to give a CC#, but they don’t charge until after the first month), leave a comment with the email address you’d like it sent to, and I”ll send one your way.  <em>  Shameless confession - you can do a trial membership without the invite from me, but if you were to sign up with emusic after the trial via invite, I’d get a 50 song credit</em>.</p>

        <p>Just a quick tip to reduce some of the noise in your Twitter stream by only showing @ replies of people you follow.  I was a little surprised more people didn’t know this was a <em>feature</em> built into Twitter. However after speaking to a couple of people at the <a href="http://miklb.com/tampa-mosi-tweetup">Tampa TweetUp</a> who use Twitter professionally and weren’t aware of the setting, I thought it might be worth detailing.</p>

<p>The basic premise is that you only show @replies from people you are following to people you following.  This isn’t a per user setting unfortunately, however, it does reduce the noise, especially for those prolific Twitters with a lot of followers they are constantly responding to.  99 times out of 100, the response is of a personal nature or has no context, so its just a distraction and noise.</p>

<p>This setting removes those, and <strong>only</strong> shows @replies to people whom you both follow.</p>

<p>To change the default setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>from the home page, click <em>settings</em></li>
<li>From <em>settings</em>, click <em>notices</em></li>
<li>for @ replies dropdown, chose <em>Show me</em> <strong>@ replies to the people I'm following</strong></li>
<li>Save your new setting</li>
</ul>
<p>Note you can turn off all @replies in this setting as well if you have no interest in messages between two users at all, however, I’ve found that this setting is the best of both worlds, in that at least there’s some context to what a response is about and generally makes sense.  No more @so-and-so, LOL!!!</p>

<p>I’ve recently blogged about <a href="http://miklb.com/cleaning-my-online-house">reducing noise in my online life</a>, and certainly this has helped immensely.  There are several people who I follow that have a broad network and use Twitter as a much more social application, but also occasionally link to interesting tidbits that I’ve found useful.  If it were not for this feature, I’d long ago stopped following them.  Now for there to be a temporary way to <em>mute</em> someone, for instance when they are live Twittering an event you have no interest in…</p>

    <div class="e-content">
        <p>I’m very excited to be attending the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampabloggers/">Tampa TweetUp</a> this Saturday night (1/17/09) at the <a href="http://mosi.org/">Tampa Museum of Science and Industry</a>.  Billed as an unstructured evening for &lt;blockquote&gt;…other local Tweeple who enjoy Twitter, blogging, and all that is social media for an evening of drinks and great conversation. Enjoy a night out of the office or home, Away from your computer, to dork out with others who share similar passions of social networking and have a few drinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>Not only is this a chance to socialize in person, MOSI is opening up the top of the IMAX dome, giving us an “exclusive 8-story high, 360 degree view of Tampa” (hopefully I’ll be able to get a few good pics), the museum will be introducing their <strong>Virtual Ambassador Program</strong>.  From what I gather of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampabloggers/calendar/9377661/">details of the event</a>, MOSI is developing a viral marketing program by giving bloggers and social media persons some <em>swag</em>, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One year free membership to the museum</li>
    <li>Free ticket to every IMAX film opening from January - June 2009 (excluding special engagements)</li>
    <li>Free ticket to Body Worlds 3 and the Story of the Heart opening January 22, 2009 - The Original Exhibit of Real Human Bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>in exchange for a “6 month commitment in helping raise community awareness online about the museum, Body Worlds exhibit, IMAX, and other MOSI offerings”.  I have every intention in participating in the program, as I’d certainly enjoy attending events and exhibits and then blogging/Twittering about them afterward.</p>

<p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/tweetup.jpg" alt="tweetup!" class="left" />In regards to the TweetUp itself, ever since attending <a href="http://www.barcamporlando.org/">BarCamp Orlando</a>, I’ve wanted to connect with local bloggers and web geeks like myself.  To that end, I’ve failed, as scheduling conflicts prevented me from attending <a href="http://barcamptampabay.com/">BarCamp Tampa</a>, as well as a few local blogger meetups.  However, I swore to myself that this year I would make a concerted effort to be available for these events, as well as actively help foster more of them.  I read with envy tweets from people in places like Philadelphia and Orlando who are connecting in real life with other bloggers and developers. I don’t want to wait until I’m in a <a href="http://blogorlando.com/">different city</a> to meet and connect with <a href="http://www.sarahintampa.com/">folks who live down the road</a>.</p>

<p>Though I don’t consider myself a big “social networker”, I do <a href="http://miklb.com/why-twitter-is-just-em-cool-em">love me some Twitter</a>, and certainly understand their place in today’s web.  I am actually taking my first steps in embracing a broader view of social networking by integrating some of the features available in <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a> into a site I’m developing for a client.  I’ve got a long way to go, but it’s certainly been an enlightening process, and has undeniably changed my attitude towards sites like Facebook in that just because I personally do not participate in a particular network, it doesn’t mean the network has no value.  That said, I don’t think I will ever say the same thing about MySpace.</p>
