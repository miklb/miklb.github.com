                <p>I just can’t say enough about this <a href="http://www.emusic.com">site</a>, and have been that way for the 5 on and off years I’ve been using it.  I’ve downloaded everything from Charlie Parker to the Cows.  Some of the recent stuff I’ve downloaded includes <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/11573/11573581.html">Tres Chicas</a>, <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/11506/11506025.html">Minus the Bear</a>, and some old stuff including <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/11625/11625629.html">fIREHOSE’s </a> if’n.
So if you are interested in a free trial -50 downloads (will require credit card, but won’t be charged unless you don’t cancel after month), and want to help me get some free downloads (if you like the service and keep it after the month trial, I get 50 downloads myself), leave a comment or use my <a href="http://www.miklb.com/contact">Contact Page</a>.  I’ll send you the special link that will help me get the hook up too.</p>

                <p>An interesting<a href="http://www.beadesigngroup.com/blog/archives/2006/03/five_steps_to_font_freedom.html">post and comments</a> regarding type face and web design.  While I struggle to learn the basics, and don’t <em>really</em> notice the difference in types, I continue to read on the subject, and found a useful <a href="http://typetester.maratz.com/">on-line tool</a> to compare fonts, and the many other options that CSS allows in setting typography.  I really am trying to approach my learning of web design from a usability aspect, vs a pure aesthetic one, which typsetting can have a huge effect on.  Still a long road, to say the least.</p>

                <p>So, I’ve been toiling away for years now with outdated G3 macs, and kept hemming and hawing, waiting for the “next wave” of new Macs.  Well, I couldn’t take it any longer, and broke down and grabbed one of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">dual-core Mac Minis</a> as I had a 17” VGA monitor for the window’s box, as well as existing USB keyboard and mouse from the old imac.  So it’s up and running, albeit I need to find someone locally who can install 3rd party ram, as I’m not paying Apple $300 for a gig stick of ram so than can install it for free.  Maybe Comp-USA?  Anyway, one thing that I noticed right off the bat was FireFox was not liking running on Rosetta, the built in conversion for older apps to the new intel processor.  So I was all but switching back to Safari, as FF was just choking.  That is, until today, when I found an “unofficial” <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mac:Intel">build</a> of the soon to be released universal binary of FF.  Sweet.  All of my extensions work with “DeerPark”, and things load as fast as they should be, no hang ups. (so far).  I’m really loving the move to Tiger as well, not to mention the shear fact of having a processor and HD meant for this century :).  I haven’t really had to time to play with any of the iLife apps, or use Front Row, but all in due time.
No to start saving for when the new 17” macbook pros come out.</p>

                <p>When I first started using RSS, I choose <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire Lite</a> and was quite pleased with the functionality.  I then discovered <a href="http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html">Vienna</a> an open source, free, aggregator.  Which  I liked a little better than  NetNewsWire.  I then went on my merry way adding and subtracting feeds, and keeping up with multiple sites with no problems.  Then I got my new desktop computer, all snazzy with OS Tiger, and have begun using it much, much, more than I ever did the old one.  Thus a dilemma began, how to keep track of what has been read and what hasn’t when switching from desktop to laptop.  Enter <a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarious</a>.  I can host it on my server, and access it from both machines, and, voilá , no need to use a desktop aggregator, no need to deal with someone elses hosted aggregator, and ads, I’m sure.  It was quite easy to install (though I did have to manually import the sql database info), and easily imported my opml file from vienna, so all my feeds were picked up, and I never lossed a beat.  You can take a look at my feeds at <a href="http://www.miklb.com/rss">Miklb’s Feeds</a>.  Right now it’s the vanilla default install, but I intend to give it some customization (like I have free time right now…)
So, take a look, maybe you’ll find a feed worth adding to your reader of choice, or maybe you’ll decide to give Gregarius a shot yourself.</p>
