Not always a great idea, but this version has been in development for some time, and about to be released as .5.4.  I’d like to thank Adam Kalsey for his help via IRC, and for his theme.  I really want to look closer at the the theme system, I really think it’s similar to WordPress’s system.  Adam’s theme is definitely an improvement in a lot of ways over the default theme, but I’d like to maybe soften it up a bit.  For some reason, my eyes just don’t work with the grays.  Especially the header image.While I’m on the subject, I was checking out Dave Winer’s Share your OPML.  I haven’t added my OPML yet, but I did discover Mark Cuban’s Blog Maverick.  I’m not a big basketball fan, but of all the interviews I’ve seen/read, I’ve found him interesting.  Reading his posts left me with a similar feeling.  I’ve always secretly wished he would buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from the Glazers.  Who knows.  Anyway, I’m off to the OPML site to find more feeds for my reading pleasure." />
