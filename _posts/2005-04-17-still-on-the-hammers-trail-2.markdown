So I'm still hot on the Tom DeLay dirt, as I just can't get the guy out of my head.  Doesn't hurt that every time I go to the New York Times, there's an another <a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/04/17/politics/17delay.html?pagewanted=1">article </a>about the guy, so it just drives me to do as much reading as I can.  So from the Times article, I started looking at some of DeLay's home town papers.  The first, <a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?brd=1574&Nav_Sec=69990">, The Fort Bend Southwest Sun </a> appears as a DeLay sympathizer.  Though there were a few letters to the editor that criticize "The Hammer".  I then headed over to <a href="http://www.fortbendstar.com/033005/burner033005.htm"> The Fort Bend Southwest Star (not to be confused with the Sun)</a>, and Bev's corner.  Bev is the owner/editor of the Star, and now some how embroiled as the hometown enemy of DeLay.  From first glance, her writing appears to just be a call it as she sees it Texan.  However, she has an insight into DeLay's backyard, that I think a few more of us would like to know.
One tasty tidbit that I haven't seen discussed is one possible reason that DeLay hasn't been indicted in Texas:
<blockquote>...why Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle hasn't indicted Tom DeLay yet...
 The scoop I heard is that Tom's Austin attorney is a former Travis County Assistant District Attorney under Earle and has all the dirt on Earle. Something about shennigans in the medical examiner's office in Travis County and Earle's knowledge of it. Supposedly, all the details of the Travis County story are on the verge of breaking....</blockquote>
