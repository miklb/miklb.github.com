                <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/la_purchase.png" class="right" alt="Louisiana Purchase Map" />Watching MSNBC this evening, the Haitian Ambassador to the United States reminded me, and declared to the rest of the country it was Haiti who helped the United States make the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a>.  The comments were in direct response to Pat Robertson’s <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0110/Robertson_Haiti_cursed_since_Satanic_pact.html">despicable comments about Haiti’s “deal with the devil”</a>.</p>
                <p>Had Haiti not defeated Napoleon’s army in Saint-Domingue, the course of history would have changed dramatically.  We often forget such events, and take our country for granted, not thinking such a small country could have had such a monumental effect on our history and success.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this bit of history aside, I can’t believe there’s an American alive who would want to politicize and criticize the rush to help the people of Haiti (<em><em>cough</em>, Limbaugh, <em>cough</em></em>).  I’ve tried to do my little part after seeing a <a href="http://twitter.com/servint/status/7723703494">tweet</a> that <a href=" http://www.smalldog.com/product/42760/donation-to-doctors-without-borders">Small Dog Electronics was matching donations to Doctors Without Borders</a>.  All I could think about is the families of all the people that I’ve worked with over the years in the restaurant business, and what if it was my family.  I know they would do the same.</p>

                <p><img class="right" alt="jquery-logo" src="http://miklb.com/user/files/jquery-logo.png" />I will never be a javascript ninja, but that doesn’t stop me from voraciously collecting bookmarks to jQuery plugins and tutorlals. I’ve vowed to myself to become better acquainted with the library this year, and what better way than to follow <a href="http://jquery14.com/">14 Days of jQuery</a>? 14 Days of jQuery is launching on, wait, for it January 14<sup>th</sup>, to celebrate the release of jQuery 1.4, which happens to also be the birthday of the incredibly useful, lightweight library.</p>
                <p>What is particularly nice about this event is that it it’s being managed by the actual jQuery team, and not just some people looking to cash in on its popularity, so I look forward to the new releases, videos and tutorials that will be announced over the two weeks.</p>
                <p>They are also doing a promotion where if you donate $20 or more to the project, you get your choice of one of several  jquery/javascript e-books.  Budget permitting, I may cash in on that, as donating to an open source project is always good karma, and a book would go far towards my goal of becoming more familiar with jQuery.  I’ve got my eye on the <cite>jQuery for Designers</cite>, which probably would cover what I’m most interested in learning.</p>

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>I’m always on the prowl for cheap (read FREE) iPhone apps, and finding a simple source for such is no easy task, at least in my searches.  Unfortunately, all the sites I’ve found that cover this type of information are so full of ads and poorly designed, it’s impossible to actually find anything useful.  I have however recently discovered at dealmac.com a <a href="http://dealmac.com/rss/541-">RSS feed specifically for discounted iPhone/iPod Touch apps.</a>. I can’t say that I’ve actually found any great deals yet through it, (I haven’t had a chance to play the recent “Let’s Golf!” game posted today), but it’s a start.  And don’t get me wrong, I have no problem paying for a quality app, and do so with perhaps too regular of frequency, but still like finding a deal when I can, especially on games, which I know I’ll only play a few times, or very rarely.</p>
                <p>Do you have any sites or feeds that you’d care to share?  Tips on finding apps on sale?</p>

                <p>I was pleasantly surprised this afternoon by a <a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi#comment-4323">comment left here on the site</a> that my first Habari theme, <a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi">Mzingi</a>, had been <a href="http://www.wolfcms.org/wiki/themes:start#mzingi">ported to another CMS, WolfCMS</a>.  Though I’ve since passed Mzingi off to the official Habari project, and is now owned by the community and part of the official download, it’s a bit rewarding to see it deemed worthy of porting.  You can see a <a href="http://adajer.byethost5.com/wolf-themes">demo of it in action</a> as a WolfCMS theme.</p>
                <p>It’s also nice they gave attribution on the official site.  I’d not heard of the project before, seems like a young project that is a fork of another CMS project, but their site describes the project as something akin to Habari.</p>

                  Perhaps I’m just a sucker for a reason to say things are going to change, but this little <a href="http://moninavelarde.com/newyears/">flash site to create your 2010 resolution</a> spun one my way that dove tails into the <a href="http://miklb.com/procrastinating-to-get-things-done">last post I made on this site</a>.</p>
                <p>Speaking of the site, to ring in the new year I finally updated Habari, as it was oh, 300+ revisions behind latest commit.  Aside from having to upgrade a bunch of plugins from before the XML file as added and the info function removed, it went off without a hitch.  I also had to swap out a little code in the tweet template, but otherwise, for a script running off of trunk that hadn’t been svn upped since May, it was pretty damn painless, and a testimony to how stable it really is.</p>
                <p>I do have some ideas for my <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking site</a>, inspired by <a href="http://h0bbel.p0ggel.org/">Christian</a> and his 365 days of photos in ‘09. <em><strong>Congrats again for seeing it all the way through!</strong></em></p>
                <p>Perhaps not a dish a day, but maybe one new thing from scratch a week with a post would be a good and realistic goal.</p>
                <p>Anyway, may MMX be a shining path of peace and enlightenment paved with prosperity a…I mean, may it fucking suck less than 2009 did, and hopefully we’ll get through it a little less scarred than the last.</p>
                <p>Special thanks to <a href="http://mikelietz.com/whine">Mike Lietz</a> for talking me down from the ledge I was on after I started the upgrade, and especially for showing me the handy svn wildcard command.  Most of the plugins I had were already trunk version from the Habari-Extra’s repository, but I thought I was going to have to cd into each one and svn up, he showed me I could do &lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;svn up user/plugins/*&lt;/pre&gt; and it would step through the directories and svn them up. Handy!</p>
                <p>I’d also like to take a second to thank <a href="http://shardsofconsciousness.com/">Rick Cockrum</a> for keeping the ball moving this past summer/fall on the development side of things, I’m really looking forward to digging into the new taxonomy system, especially as I build out the cooking site.</p>
