        <p>It’s amazing how going back to work, working 60+hrs a week, and trying to assimilate a day time schedule can wreck any routine one had prior.  I finally got two days off, in a row, to rest and reflect a little on where I’m heading.  I’m really looking to establish a little more of a domestic life, call it a goal.  I’ve all but abandoned my WP endeavors the past month, and feel guilty for it.  I simply did not have the mental wherewithal.  My inbox has routinely had 100+ messages, and my RSS feed is about 4000 unread links.  Over the next week, I will catch up on my emails, start working off the RSS, and begin working on my blogs.  My WP blog, <a href="http://wpstation.com">WP Station</a> hasn’t been posted to in a month, so I’ll try to catch up on the bigger releases I’ve missed, and try and do a re-boot for the fall.  From there, I’ll probably release the theme used there.
I’m hoping some of those moves will also help me with my personal life, as that has really been a shambles.  From the monumental mistake I made in February, on through the summer, my life has been turned upside down, no really fault but my own.  There is probably no other bad decision I’ve made in my life that I’ve regretted more, and wished I had a mulligan, time machine, do-over, anything to alter the course.
Unfortunately, we don’t really get those, and I have to deal with the results of my actions, and I guess it’s time I deal a little more.
But if you are reading this, and you know who you are, I can only say I’m sorry, I regret that horrible day, and I miss you.</p>

Might as well be a copy of the Constitution on there too.  I’ve avoided blogging anything about 9.11, as so much is out there, from the issues with the ABC docudrama, the politicization of the anniversary (for instance, Bush laying the wreath at the site of the WTC, with only Republican representatives with him), etc, etc, etc.  I simply wish that at some point, those that differ on domestic issues, can rationally approach our global issues on a united front, and sanely resolve the conflicts that effect our security, both home and abroad.  I’d also like to see the powers that be see that the continued death and injury that befalls our military overseas is not a price worth continuing to pay, and find diplomatic solutions to resolve the civil war in Iraq.</p>

        <p><em>(disclaimer)</em>I’m not a coder, and this is my first attempt, I apologize if this isn’t properly documented or presented.</p>

<p>My very first WordPress Plugin!  I’ve dabbled with a lot of areas of WP, but until this <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/86463?replies=2">post</a> in the support forums, I never really had an idea or need to write one.  But after doing some reading, I found that there wasn’t a simple way to accomplish this task.  All of WP’s archive features  are based on date.</p>

<p>So with the help of alphaoide via #wordpress on IRC, I put together this simple plugin to accomplish the task.  It worked fine on my test site, but may need some TLC before being good to go.  Basically it outputs categories by name in an h2 tag, then lists post titles with a permalink to the post.</p>

<p>I tested this by creating a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Page_Templates">Page Template</a>, then inserting the plugin code within the content div of the theme.
The code to insert is
 <code>&lt; ?php mb_cat_archive(); ?&gt;</code>
(remove the space between the &lt; and ?, I’m not sure why that is getting reformatted in the post)
I suppose this could be used in a sidebar, however it may create a very long list…
So to summarize, download the file, unzip, and upload to your wp-content/plugins directory.
Activate the plugin in the dashboard.  Create the page template, inserting the above code, save, and upload to your themes directory.
Go to Write-&gt;Page, and choose the template you uploaded.
The new page should now list your categories with their appropriate posts.
I haven’t looked into how it handles posts with multiple categories, that will be on my todo list, I’m sure, if the plugin proves useful or popular.  I’d also like to add some AJAX to hide the posts until you click on the category (that would make it much more sidebar friendly), and the ability to change the h2 tag to whatever one likes.</p>

<p>You can download the file via:

What a great idea from a main stream media source.  Vanity Fair has a fake cover for <em>The Weekly Standard</em> which dogs the current efforts in Iraq.  Simply detach the fake cover from the Vanity Fair, and fold it over a copy on the newsstand, sit back, and watch the shock of the next neocon that approaches the newsstand.  Brilliant!</p>
