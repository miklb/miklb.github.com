			Couch to 5k - Day 2 Week 1

      <p>This evening I completed day 2 of the first week of couch to 5k. As exhilarating as day one was, I was equally sore the next day. Though I try to walk a little every day, there are muscles you use to jog that don’t come into play walking. That said, I wasn’t deterred, and today was my planned day 2. The schedule is 3 days a week for the first 3 weeks at least, I didn’t look beyond that.</p>
<p>One thing I did learn from day one was to not push the jog too hard to start, and was able to pace myself a bit better today. I also tried to zig-zag around the neighborhood rather than do laps around the small park near my house. The laps felt a bit too monotonous, as I was checking the app to gauge progress. Snaking through the neighborhood didn’t feel that way. It may have slowed me a bit as I didn’t have a route planned, but the app maps the run so I can check back and have a clearer idea of what would be a good loop. Speaking of, on my geek side, I’m looking at ways to export the .gpx file and create a static map of the run and post with these posts, much like the static map I created with my Instagram photos.</p>

      <p>One artifact of Jekyll that has bothered me is the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/1717">redundant blank lines</a> in the rendered HTML. In my case, I was seeing hundreds of blank lines creating the page navigation at the top of the page. It doesn’t affect what the visitor sees, but for developers who use Jekyll poor source is a bad practice. Also imagine someone new to Jekyll and HTML in general trying to view source to debug an issue. Turns out the problem is with the Liquid template language Jekyll uses. Seems the Liquid community have been <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/216">discussing the issue</a> for 3 years without a solution.</p>
<p>My first approach to solving this was to use a Ruby gem <a href="https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier">HTML Beautifier</a>. It works great, but for a site like mine with over 500 posts with a lot of tag pages, it increases the build time exponentially. To the point I’ve seen Travis time out due to the long process. Today I went looking for another solution and stumbled upon this <a href="https://gist.github.com/kerotaa/5788650">gist - remove empty lines</a>. It concerned me the plugin would increase the build time in Jekyll vs in Travis, but was pleasantly surprised it added no noticeable overhead and produces much cleaner HTML output.</p>
<p>Now I get quick build times and cleaner source.</p>

      <p>I have been telling myself all year that I was going to start this, but my body was telling me something else. Today that changed. It was just day 1, walking for 12 minutes, jogging for 8, but it feels perfect and I can’t wait for day 2.</p>

      <p>Figure for my own reference I should document the updates I’ve made to the site the last month.</p>
<p>I’ve written before that my primary goal with the reboot of this site is to embrace IndieWeb. The first step was <a href="https://miklb.com/finally-webmentons-with-jekyll-part-duex">receiving webmentions</a>, then sending them. Also in the process I, started an indiewebified <a href="https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb">Jekyll theme</a> (which I’m using on this site at the time of writing.) Part of that was to have better microformats in the markup.</p>
<p>The big itch that I wanted to scratch was implementing micropub to free myself from Twitter (something I’ve failed at thus far). With the help of <a href="http://voxpelli.com/2016/03/my-2015-in-indieweb/">Pelle Wessman</a> who shared n bit of yet to be public “glue” to pull together his <a href="https://github.com/voxpelli/node-micropub-express">other tools</a>, I set up my own micropub endpoint on a Heroku.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>  I still need to workout adding a syndication endpoint for Twitter so I can auto-tweet notes, but that is coming.</p>
<p>Once that was in place, I was able to use the tools <a href="https://aaronparecki.com">Aaron Perecki</a> built, <a href="https://quill.p3k.io">Quill</a> and <a href="https://quill.p3k.io">OwnYourGram</a>. Quill is a web based micropub publishing app, and OwnYourGram is a service that helps you <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/pesos">PESOS</a> your Instagram photos to your own site<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A lot of the experiments I’ve been doing here might be overkill for a simple blog, but are great ways to expose myself to new technologies. I’ve long had an Amazon Web Services s3 bucket set up as a CDN, but had never found a workflow to efficiently use it. With the my current build/deploy process with Travis, a copy of the Instagram photo is saved to my GitHub repository via micropub. In the build script, the image is copied to the s3 bucket, then linked to the CDN.</p>
<p>The primary reason to use the CDN was I went through the steps to get 100% on Google Pagespeed (last I checked). Since the site is primarily text and is already static it ranked pretty well, but I went ahead and configured loading critical CSS<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. (I had set that up with my old Habari theme, but Google’s added a step to async load the remaining CSS). I also had to tweak caching in nginx, which while I was in there, I went ahead and set up http/2. The primary reason I moved back from GitHub pages to my VPS was to serve the site over https with a free LetsEncrypt SSL certificate.</p>
<p>Finally, I went back and forth on analytics. I don’t <em>need</em> them, but it’s nice to see what visitors are looking for and at. I poked around at some self hosted options, ultimately decided for now that for the people who don’t want to share data with Google, there are browser tools to block sending the data, which I’m OK with, therefore using GA here isn’t forcing anyone into it.</p>
<p>I still want to do a fresh design, but only after last few kinks in Jekyll-IndieWeb theme are fixed. I’ll still use the markup as the foundation, just present it differently. As always, if you have any questions, hit me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/miklb">@miklb</a> or leave a webmention and I’ll do my best to reply.</p>
