David Broder provides an interesting outlook on the  dilemma facing the Republican controlled Congress this spring.  
It will be telling sign of the future if they can not come to some agreement on the budget, and a greater tell towards the '06 elections.  If the dems can somehow harness some momentum and become the sensible spending party, they very well may take back some control in Congress, and position a run for the White House against Bill Frist or which ever Rove do boy they run out.
Stay tuned...
