            <p>I was really looking forward to today’s confirmation of the lower price 3G iPhone.  I purposely held off (for a change) on adopting a 1st gen Apple product, knowing the 3G service would be coming.  However, now that reports have confirmed that you will <strong>have</strong> to sign a contract, I’m not so sure now that I will be adopting the new phone.  I genuinely do not use a cell phone for talking enough to justify signing such a contract, and being required to have such a plan (what $70 a month?).  The previous $20 a month data plan plus minimal talk time per minute was fine with me, as I have used it with other “smartphones”.</p>
            <p>I will be curious to see how they treat 1st gen iPhone users who currently are doing pay as you go plus data plans.  Perhaps those will still be allowed to use the prepay, and I’ll pick one up on teh cheap, until I can justify signing a contract paying for that much phone usage.</p>
            <p>My other option is to wait to see what happens to iPod Touch prices, as I may get just as much use out of one of those as an iPhone.</p>
            <p>If anyone has a suggestion for a smartphone that can be used with pay as you go and unlimited data plan with AT&amp;T, has a great web browser support, bluetooth, and is iSync capable, I’d love to hear about it. <em>edit</em>:  and can be purchased new/used for $200 or less without a contract.</p>

            <p>Without getting into the whys and hows this statement came about, I find it very simple, yet poignant and applicable to many of life’s situations.</p>

              We're still learning to walk, and we're going to trip every now and then and sometimes when we run, we're going to fall on our faces. But as long as we get up, try again, and learn something from the experience, in the end, skinned knees and all, it'll be worth it.

            <p><em>edit</em> - might I add, I’m in a new-ish romantic relationship, which <strong>very</strong> recently hit a bump, and perhaps this analogy hit home there more than anywhere.</p>

            <p><a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2008/04/svn_notifier.php">SVN Notifiier</a> is a handy little Mac Dashboard widget that, using Growl, will notify you when a local working copy is out of date.  I’ve not quite gotten the “sticky” notice to work, but I just might need to edit the actual Growl settings.</p>
            <p>Still, it’s nice to be able at a glance check your dashboard, or see a little growl notice pop up.</p>

            <p>This past week it was proposed and not shot down in flames that my first foray into a Habari theme, <a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi">mzingi</a> , intended as a simple, image free theme to be used as a foundation for building proper themes, should be included into the core download of <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a>.</p>
            <p>I was humbled and honored to say the least, and so from here on out, all development for this project will be maintained by the community.</p>
            <p>Thanks to all who’ve helped, and shared their appreciation for it’s intended purpose, and I trust the community will continue to use it for creating full fledged themes.  Feels a little odd, but satisfying at the same time.</p>

            <p>I recently <a href="http://miklb.com/updated-themes">updated my themes</a>, and since that time a change has been made in trunk in how pagination is handled.  All 3 three themes have been updated for this change.  I will be leaving download links for the previous versions up as well, as I <em>believe</em> those versions should work with 0.4.1.  If you experience any problems with either version, please set me know.</p>
            <p>Downloads and more info on each theme available on their original post.</p>

            <p>Also, I have a <a href="http://themes.miklb.com">demo site</a> up and running to check them out.  I still need to tweak the themeswitcher plugin so you can only select certain themes from your theme directories, so note that only <strong>my 3 themes</strong> have the switcher code.</p>
