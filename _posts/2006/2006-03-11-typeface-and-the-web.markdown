An interesting<a href="http://www.beadesigngroup.com/blog/archives/2006/03/five_steps_to_font_freedom.html">post and comments</a> regarding type face and web design.  While I struggle to learn the basics, and don't <em>really</em> notice the difference in types, I continue to read on the subject, and found a useful <a href="http://typetester.maratz.com/">on-line tool</a> to compare fonts, and the many other options that CSS allows in setting typography.  I really am trying to approach my learning of web design from a usability aspect, vs a pure aesthetic one, which typsetting can have a huge effect on.  Still a long road, to say the least.
