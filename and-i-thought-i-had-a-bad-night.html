      <p>As much as I love food, and cooking, and know that real restaurants are out there with caring owners and concerned staff, the combination of my hard-headedness and bad luck, I’ve not worked in one in a long time.  I loathe working in a restaurant right now, and pray for the day that I discover that I really can make a living working with the web, or some other career opens up, but until then, I’m in it.
And with that off my chest, I really had a bad night, and was looking forward to getting home, and watching my favorite hockey team take on their in-state rival. (yeah, another sports post, go figure).  So I settle in on the couch with some munchies and fire up the DVR, and no sooner than the game starts, it was over.  And it was <a href="http://www.tbo.com/sports/lightning/MGBDTF869KE.html">downhill from there.</a>  So thanks Lightning for reminding me that I might not have been the only one who had a bad day, and that you’ve got to put it behind you, learn what you can from your mistakes, and accept the fact that somedays, it’s just not your day.  Here’s to a better tomorrow, and a run for the Cup.</p>
