                <p>I didn’t grow up listening to the show, but I did listen to enough AM country growing up traveling around the country and out and about with my father to have a deep appreciation for what it meant to those who did. Visiting the Opry is still on my bucket list.</p>
                <p>It appears the Opry house in its current incarnation turns 40 this month, and Garden &amp; Gun’s article <a href="http://gardenandgun.com/blog/lordy-lordy-oprys-40">Lordy, Lordy, the Opry’s 40!</a> has a few quotes from artists who’ve performed there over the years. My favorite is from Ricky Skaggs.</p>
                <blockquote>“I used to go to sleep on my grandfather’s lap, listening to the Grand Ole Opry in his Ford pickup truck out by the barn. The sound would come and go up in those Kentucky mountains, but when it would come back in, it was the greatest sound in the world."</blockquote>
                <p>Perhaps the reference to sleeping on his grandfather’s lap as the music came and went is what struck me, as I my earliest memories of music were with my head asleep on dad’s lap as we drove across country.</p>

                <p>I’ve long been a fan of David Seah, but something <a href="http://davidseah.com/blog/2014/02/the-quest-for-productivity-enhancing-programming-pants/">he wrote today</a> really resonated with me in relation to <strong>getting things done.</strong></p>
                <blockquote>I was armed with a new insight from The Now Habit: say “I choose” instead of “I have to”. When I say “I choose”, I am putting myself in charge of MY OWN MISSION and rising above whatever primordial slug-like fears lurk in the darkest recesses of my psyche.</blockquote>
                <p>I often recall a similar exercise a wise man shared with me. He handed me a tennis ball and asked me to “try” and throw it. I easily tossed it across the room. He retrieved the ball and handed it back to me. He said, “no, <strong>try</strong> and throw it.”</p>
                <p>At this point I was confused. I just had. So I threw the ball with a bit more force. His response was the same. Finally, he told me, “you either throw it or you don’t. There is no in between. The next time you say ‘I am trying’, remember the ball.”</p>
                <p>This was all in response to a conversation about me saying I was <strong>trying</strong> to be a better boss/boyfriend/person.</p>
                <p>Tomorrow I will choose to be a better partner/boyfriend/person.</p>

                  Use Pythonista to Get Weather of Current Location into Drafts App

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>My quest began when I began using Drafts app (among many other ways) to keep a fishing log. I created a TextExpander fill-in snippet to quickly enter what (if anything) was caught, the date, the type of lure(s) used, etc. I really wanted to automate adding the weather conditions as well, but alas, my search for that solution turned up nothing…until yesterday.</p>
                <p>It started when <a href="https://twitter.com/drdrang">@drdrang</a> shared a <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a> script to <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/01/location-and-leverage/">leverage the location inside iOS</a>. Later he shared <a href="https://gist.github.com/hiilppp/8268816">another version</a>, from <a href="https://twitter.com/hiilppp">@hiilppp</a>.</p>
                <p>Armed with that knowledge and a rudimentary knowledge of the <a href="https://developer.forecast.io">forecast.io API</a>, I set off to <strike>steal</strike> crib some Python usage of their API. Enter  <a href="https://twitter.com/jayhickey">@jayhickey</a> and his <a href="https://github.com/jayhickey/Pythonista-Scripts/blob/master/PySky.py">PySky</a> script. While written for the v1 Dark Skies API, it gave me enough Python to convert to the new v2 of Forecast.io.</p>
                <p>The result?</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/miklb/8346411.js"></script>
                <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/miklb/8346411">original gist</a></p>
                <p>This version simply grabs the current weather summary and temperature from your current location, meant to be used with <a href="https://twitter.com/draftsapp">@draftsapp</a> as a URL action <code class="highlighter-rouge">pythonista://py_forecast?action=run&amp;argv=[[draft]]</code>. Dr. Drang suggests using <a href="https://gist.github.com/omz/4076735">New From Gist</a>, however I had better success using <a href="http://ioctocat.com">iOctocat</a>. There is an “open in…” dialog when viewing your gists or starred gists, and pick Pythonista.</p>
                <p>Certainly for my fishing log I am expanding on this to include wind, sunrise and set times as well as the recently added moon phase. I figured a more generic version would be best shared, but please do not hesitate to leave a comment or  ask me a question on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/miklb">@miklb</a>. I’ll do my best to help, as I’m indebted to the aforementioned gents for sharing their code and helping in the first place.</p>

                <p>I stumbled upon this quote from Thomas Keller a few days ago, and it’s been haunting me ever since.</p>
                <blockquote>It’s not about passion. Passion is something that we tend to overemphasize, that we certainly place too much importance on. Passion ebbs and flows. To me, it’s about desire. If you have constant, unwavering desire to be a cook, then you’ll be a great cook. If it’s only about passion, sometimes you’ll be good and sometimes you won’t. You’ve got to come in every day with a strong desire. With passion, if you see the first asparagus of the springtime and you become passionate about it, so much the better, but three weeks later, when you’ve seen that asparagus every day now, passions have subsided. What’s going to make you treat the asparagus the same? It’s the desire.</blockquote>
                <p><span class="small">Via <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672282/thomas-keller-on-why-passion-shouldn-t-drive-you">Fast Company</a> </span></p>
                <p>While I certainly can relate to the culinary element of this – I think I had the desire – it strikes a nerve more so in my <em>career</em> as a web developer. I think I had the passion, just not the desire. Three weeks after the first time I used some new tool or trick, it lost its luster. I didn’t get excited, I wasn’t the type of person to want to get up early and do it all over again. So I spent the last year or so of being a developer chasing the newest shiny thing so I didn’t have to deal with the everyday.</p>
                <p>Even after reading this, I’m not sure it would have struck a nerve if I didn’t think I’d found a new profession that I do have the desire for. Long after the bloom is off the rose, I’m still excited to do the routine.</p>
