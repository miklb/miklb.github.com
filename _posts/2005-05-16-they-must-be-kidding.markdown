<strong>It looks like since I posted this, the WH strong armed who ever it was at the State Dept enough that they recanted their story, forcing Newsweek into recanting the blurb in the magazine.  That doesn't change the fact that it takes more than one little article to set off the Middle East</strong>
Everyone from the lapdog of the White House, Scott McClellan, on down to the talking heads at the State Department, are lambasting the blurb in the Newsweek
<!--more-->
 article about the desecration of the Koran.  You mean to tell me, that one little article single handily ruined the United States' global reputation?  Yeah, right, we had such a stellar reputation to begin with...that's like telling a football player he's to blame for his team's losing, 'cause he dropped the ball on the last play.  Because of course the other 150 plays before his, were all <strong>perfectly executed</strong>.
And doesn't anyone think, that in light of the Mike Wallace witch hunt, that maybe,  just maybe, Newsweek had enough legitimate knowledge of the story, that they have refused to come off the story completely?  Otherwise, you would already see a full retraction and a head rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue.
But come on, a <i>blurb</i> in one magazine, sets off the entire region?  That's like blaming WWI on a single assassination.

What it really is, is another scape goat for this administration.  Somewhere else to focus the blame, while they conduct more closed door meetings on our future.
