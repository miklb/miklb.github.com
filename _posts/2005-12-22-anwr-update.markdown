Incase you missed it, Democrats and two Republicans, Mike DeWine and Lincoln Chafee, stood their ground, and managed to keep ANWR off the defense bill.  Pete Dominenici of New Mexico (?) has already vowed to add it to a filibuster proof budget bill in the spring, one I'm sure that will be full of all kinds of pork barrel projects.  So warm up that keyboard and start writing your represenatives, and voice your opinion, be it on ANWR, or the President spying on fellow Americans.
