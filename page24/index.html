        <p>Little did I know that I needed to create a separate feed for comments at Feedburner for it to actually work with the Feedburner plugin for Habari.  So if for some reason you wanted to subscribe to site wide comments vs a single post, it’s now working.  I’ve also added recent comments to the sidebar, complete with a spiffy excerpt of the comment.  Thanks to whomever created the summarize function, it only took a PHP n00b like myself a couple of minutes to figure out how to have a <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Recent_Comments">separate comment content excerpt in Habari</a>.</p>

        <p>Finally made it out of the house after a week of being holed up sick, and stopped off to get a case for the iPhone.  First stop was the Apple store, only to be terribly disappointed with the selection.  I did however pick up some <a href="http://www.powersupportusa.com/products/iphone3G_antiglare.php">anti-glare film</a>, which as advertised “provides traction for improved responsiveness”.  I was worried about bubbles, but it applied just fine, with only one small bubble, however the anti-glare totally hides it when the phone is on.  From there, I hit Best Buy and grabbed an inexpensive, utilitarian <a href="http://rocketfishproducts.com/pc-110-7-rocketfish-silicone-case-for-apple-iphone.aspx">silicone case</a>.  It’s quite sufficient for now, at least until I get a dock, not sure it would fit in one, though it’s a fairly thin sleeve.  I’d highly recommend the anti-glare film to any iPhone user.</p>

        <p>Interestingly enough, <a href="http://asymptomatic.net/2009/01/10/2780/why-cant-it">Owen writes about his blogging style</a>; I was remarking the other night that no wonder no one reads my blog, the posts are too long.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to blog more, but tend to write these long diatribes, which smack against the conventions of online writing that I’ve read.  I used to tell myself that I blogged for my own benefit, and that I didn’t care if anyone read it, but I’m fooling myself.  Every time I write something, I find myself checking stats and looking for comments, so obviously I do care. To that end I am also looking to tailor my blogging style to cater to easier digestion, regular readership and the potential for a discussion to ensue.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2008/03/15/21/">few references</a> (actually, Bleacher Report has quite a bit of good reference, be it sports related or not), but am looking for more.  Do you have any quality references for online writing?</p>

<p><em>Update</em> - I’ve found a few links that have some good information.</p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of articles by<a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/"> Jakob Nielsen on writing for the web</a></li>
<li>Actually linked from the previous set of articles, but worthy of listing again, <a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v1/articles/web-writing-for-many-interest-levels.htm">web writing for many interest levels</a>, is very informative.  I particularly like the methodology list.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/contribute/styleguide/">A List Apart's style guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll update this list as I find additional resources.</p>

        <p>In a case of life imitating art imitating life <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/baltimore_city/bal-md.ci.indict10jan10,0,48597.story">the Baltimore mayor was indicted</a> on 12 counts of felony theft, perjury, fraud and misconduct in office.  I can see Lester Freeman and his crew heading the investigation, Bunk and McNulty laughing about the headlines as they pass a bottle of Jameson’s in an empty lot.</p>

<p>And from reading the article, it sounds like the mayor and her attorney are taking pages right out of the Clay Davis/Clarence Royce playbook.</p>

<p>Man, that was a great show, I really look forward to another project from Simon.</p>

PANTONE® 14-0848 Mimosa, a “warm, engaging yellow…no other color expresses hope and reassurance more than yellow”.  Interestingly enough, COLOURlovers has relatively few palettes <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/search?hsv=&amp;sortType=ts&amp;sortBy=desc&amp;query=mimosa&amp;hex=&amp;lover=&amp;hueOption0=&amp;hueOption1=&amp;hueOption2=&amp;publishedBeginDate=12%2F27%2F2004&amp;publishedEndDate=01%2F09%2F2009&amp;x=29&amp;y=7">tagged mimosa</a>, and of those few are inspiring.</p>

<p>I’ll admit color and color theory aren’t my strong suit, I tend to rely on Color Schemer Studio and sites like COLOURlovers.  I did put together this palatte based on mimosa.</p>
