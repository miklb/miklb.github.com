    <meta name="description" content="Letter to Apple Support (kottke.org)How often did I hear this lament during the short time I worked at Apple.  “I just bought my iPod 5 weeks ago…Why didn’t you tell me that a new powerbook would be out 2 weeks after Christmas..”  All of which you couldn’t tell customers, even though you were reading the rumor sites, and knew an update of some kind would be  forthcoming, but company rules forbade you from discussing that with customers, because, after all, “they’re just rumors”.  Occassionally, Apple will allow for a return if it’s within a time frame, and the customer can then pay the difference of the new product and the old.But regarding Kottke’s dilemma, the macbook pro is taking orders starting today, but the question is when will it ship.  He, like many others who found a powerbook on the shelf, or got one shipped, probably knew the intel laptops were on the horizon, whether or not they were going to be a “pro” level release first may not have been leaked, but by summer, most thought.  Which is when I’m guessing most who don’t order this week will get their hands on the new machine anyway.  So as I said, the question is, did they need the machine before, say, April? Or could they have squeaked out 6 more months  to see what happens.  And though I’m a firm believer in Apple’s products, I’m not unfamiliar with the chances that a bad egg can come down the pipe at anytime, and those who purchase the the macbook pro will be bitching they wished they had bought a G4 powerbook.  So it’s a gamble, and Apple’s been fairly straightfoward with running out new machines or updates every 6 months.  So chances are, by June there will be a macbook home with similar specs as today’s announcement, for $600 less.  And on a side note, I’m guessing someone of Jason Kottke’s stature just might get their exchange." />

                How often did I hear this lament during the short time I worked at Apple.  “I just bought my iPod 5 weeks ago…Why didn’t you tell me that a new powerbook would be out 2 weeks after Christmas..”  All of which you couldn’t tell customers, even though you were reading the rumor sites, and <em>knew</em> an update of some kind would be  forthcoming, but company rules forbade you from discussing that with customers, because, after all, “they’re just rumors”.  Occassionally, Apple will allow for a return if it’s within a time frame, and the customer can then pay the difference of the new product and the old.
