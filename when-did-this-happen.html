At $2.80+ a gallon for gas, and record profits for these companies, you’d think that when they sell you water, you’d get enough to keep the vehicle running long enough to fill the tank back up.Self preservation, or something.  Then again, I doubt they really care about those who aren’t driving around a brand new Escalade…" />
