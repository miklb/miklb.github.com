While surfing through some blogs, I came across <a href="http://jarrarsupariver.blogspot.com/">Iraqi Bloggers Central</a>, and the lead post was the same question proposed to several persons, "What would you do if given 5 minutes alone with Saddam Hussein."  There are some poignant answers, some revealing answers, and then this one from Fayrouz:<blockquote>I would make him wear a Hawaiian costume, force him to drink a shot of tequila -- He likes Whisky-- then ask him how it feels like to lose his two monstrous sons.

Just for fun, I'll take Cuban cigars with me and NO, I won't give him any.

This is my type of 5 minutes torture.</blockquote>
Now, I will say I don't know who these persons are, where they live, and what direct involvement they have with the tumultuous events of the past few years in that country, but it certainly gave me a loud guffaw when I came across that one.  As angered as I am by my countries "reasons" for becoming involved, and the loss of life on all sides, I have to feel that something good CAN come from this.  However, with the recent announcement of ethnic militias being OKed, I fear that much more bloodshed will result before true "peace" is achieved.
