              <p>That said, if you’d like to check it out, I’ve got 40 odd invites available, just leave a comment and I’ll be sure to send one.  Only thing I ask is that you after sign up, look me up (miklb) and add me as a contact, as the system doesn’t automatically add invites to your contact list.</p>
