Well, I'm a mid thirties slacker, who has tried unsuccessfully to find the right restaurant to be a chef at, and am so far behind the curve that I'm afraid I would never make a comfortable living working in web design/development, that I'm sorta in limbo.  Meanwhile I try and fish when I can, and keep plugging away at both food and the web.  In between all that, I try to keep up with local, national, and global news and politics, and rant about that which drives me nuts.  If you need some cooking done, or chef, or some lessons, visit my <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking site</a>, likewise if you'd like to employ a burgeoning web designer/WordPress designer, visit <a href="http://www.bishopblogworks.com">Bishop Blog Works</a>.  Otherwise, comment to your hearts content on anything you read.
