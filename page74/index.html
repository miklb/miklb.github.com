        Who Hired This Guy??

    <time datetime="2005-11-17T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">17 Nov 2005</time>

    <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/17/AR2005111701879.html?nav=rss_politics">Washington Post</a> OK, sure, when ever you’ve got billions of dollars flowing around with out a check and balance system, there’s bound to be some corruption.  Much has been made about the no-bid contracts, the mis-management of money by the Bremer lead provisional Authority, and finally formal charges have been levied.  My question is this?  Who their right mind hired this guy Stein to work their in the first place.  Talk about fox in the hen house.  Guy was found guilty of fraud in ‘96, spent some time in jail even.  Hello!!  He even paid some of his restitution from the previous crime with the kickbacks he got for this one.  His wife paid taxes! 3 years late!  I’d love, just love to know who he <em>knew</em> to get the job.  And I’d like to hear how it wasn’t thought out on how to hire people to oversee <strong>REGIONS</strong> without proper background checks.  This wasn’t a low level guy getting a few thousand dollars, this was a guy who got .5 million in kickbacks for fixing over 13 million in contracts, which never really were done.  And the investigator says 50 more are being looked at.  More examples of poor planning by the administration.  Thank God though they were able to “negotiate” the deals with Haliburton months before the invasion…</p>

        Alex King asks, "Should I Host Another WordPress Theme Competition?"
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2005-11-10T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">10 Nov 2005</time>

    <p>So with the impending release of WP 1.6, Alex King <a href="http://www.alexking.org/blog/2005/11/09/another-wordpress-theme-competition/">ponders</a> the pluses and minuses of hosting another theme contest, and asked for opinions.  So as someone who came along WP as he was starting his second contest, may I add that the primary thing I remember from that contest, and perhaps should be consider if a third comes along, is the delineation of where one theme ends and another begins.  If I take Kubrick, put a new header on it, change some fonts and colors, is that a new theme?  I realize that is a fine line, but with a panel in place to screen a theme that’s hosted on the contestants own site, a consensus can be reached as whether or not it’s original. 
Second suggestion, phases of judging.  Contestants host the design, and each category is narrowed, to say, 3.  At that point, the theme is then put on a clean install to test the safety, and code.  Thus eliminating some of the worries. 
But I will say, the second contest was surely a motivator to get more involved with WP and explore its community, which subsequently opened my eyes to many more things web related.  Where my knowledge is now, can only be contributed to my exposure to WP at that point.  And I can only hope that 1.6 and a theme contest does that for someone lese like my self.  So I encourage and will support, be it $$ or time, to see that another does happen.</p>

    <p>How bloody cool is this: <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/stamps/">ZazzleStamps</a> your own image on a real, licensed stamp.  I think 20 stamps is around $16, and the more you buy, the cheaper they get.  And if you’ve got a <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> account, then you can easily choose an image from there for the stamp.</p>
