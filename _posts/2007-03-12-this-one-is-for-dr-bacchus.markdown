<img class="left" src="http://www.miklb.com/user/files/zippy_01.jpg" alt="zippy" />Lately I've spent a fair amount of time on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/habari/">Habari's </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> channel, mostly because some really smart people are there, and because <a href="http://wooga.drbacchus.com/">Dr Bacchus</a> has a bot on the channel that if you type "yow", will randomly quote Zippy the Pinhead.  I first discovered Zippy while living in Denver in the early 90's.  it was a daily comic in the (<strong>I think</strong>)<em>Rocky Mountain News</em>.  Not long after, being a casual fan of alt-comics, I discovered <a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/">Fantagraphics</a>, and then soon after they published several collections of Zippy comics.  I still own the first 3 issues of the collection somehow (the time soon after moving back from Colorado can be a bit hazy, to say the least). 

<img class="right" src="http://www.miklb.com/user/files/zippy_02.jpg" alt="zippy" />I don't even begin to consider myself a Zippy fanatic, and have barely kept up with the comic since those days, but I can't help but <strong>l</strong>augh <strong>o</strong>ut <strong>l</strong>oud when ever I type those three letters on IRC.  No matter how bored, frustrated, or confused I might be with my situation at hand, good ol' mzuri and his Zippy quotes pick me up, and break the ice just enough to keep going.  So the next time you are having a rough time just think of your Zippy, and quotes like:
<blockquote>"Wouldn't it be great, Zip, if th' spirit of Halloween could last all year long?"

"Yow! A never ending orgy of apple-bobbing and miniature mars bars!"</blockquote>
