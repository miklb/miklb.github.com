                <p>I have been lamenting on whether or not I wanted to bring back my old content or start completely from scratch. I’d been leaning towards starting over, but today in Habari IRC channel, someone linked to their blog on the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, which led me to checking this blog. My <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050319093337/http://www.miklb.com/blog/">earliest records</a> are sans any theme. I’m not sure what determined what got cached visually, but the earliest version of this site that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051030021240/http://www.miklb.com/blog/">includes design</a> got me feeling nostalgic about having had this site active off and on for almost 8 years. Between that old theme and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060814212436/http://www.miklb.com/blog/">this one</a> I think I will work out bringing back the old content.</p>
                <p>For reference, I’ve been running on Habari since September 2008, never looking back.</p>

                <p>This was new to me, but I’ve been using Terminal.app a lot lately setting up my new VPS. As a big fan of the <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized Color Scheme</a>, began to wonder if I could use that with Terminal.app. A quick Google search quickly returned <a href="https://github.com/tomislav/osx-lion-terminal.app-colors-solarized">OS Lion terminal colors - Solarized</a>. As I’m still on Lion, it’s a simple as downloading the zip, extracting, double clicking the preferred scheme (light or dark) to activate it. The readme file says Mountain Lion users can import the file via preferences. The only hitch was as a user of <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com">TotalFinder</a> I couldn’t get it to use the new default Solarized color scheme.</p>
                <p>Another quick search turned up that this was not a bug, but a (bad IMVHO) design decision. If the Visor color scheme is available, regardless of the default scheme in Terminal, it will use Visor. Apparently the options are renaming the color schemes, or, as I chose to do, delete Visor scheme from Terminal.</p>
                <p>Though I use the light scheme for all of my text editors, I’m leaning towards the dark for TotalTerminal. My next step will probably be to edit my .bash profile to change the prompt colors, but I’m not sure I’m that big a geek today.</p>

                <p>This site has been down for several months due to a multitude of reasons. That said, I’m still not 100% what I’m going to do next, but I’m leaning towards keeping it completely free of any and all content that I accumulated the first seven years. While there is something to be said for posterity, an equal argument can be made for clean starts.</p>
                <p>Currently I’m running the latest stable version of <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a> on an inexpensive VPS that is only running Ngnix and Sqlite. No Apache, no Mysql. That part will stay.  From there, I’m just not quite sure, other than I will not have a filter on my content ever again.</p>
                <p>For the one or two people who stumble into this new incarnation, I am no longer doing any type of web work/development professionally, save for a business that I’m helping <em>ehem</em>, “bootstrap”. I’ll be writing more about that for sure, suffice to say this <em>NY Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24labor-t.html?_r=5&amp;pagewanted=all">article</a> touches on where I’ve been mentally and professionally the last couple of months.</p>
