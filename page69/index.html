                  How often did I hear this lament during the short time I worked at Apple.  “I just bought my iPod 5 weeks ago…Why didn’t you tell me that a new powerbook would be out 2 weeks after Christmas..”  All of which you couldn’t tell customers, even though you were reading the rumor sites, and <em>knew</em> an update of some kind would be  forthcoming, but company rules forbade you from discussing that with customers, because, after all, “they’re just rumors”.  Occassionally, Apple will allow for a return if it’s within a time frame, and the customer can then pay the difference of the new product and the old.
But regarding Kottke’s dilemma, the macbook pro is taking orders starting today, but the question is when will it ship.  He, like many others who found a powerbook on the shelf, or got one shipped, probably knew the intel laptops were on the horizon, whether or not they were going to be a “pro” level release first may not have been leaked, but by summer, most thought.  Which is when I’m guessing most who don’t order this week will get their hands on the new machine anyway.  So as I said, the question is, did they need the machine before, say, April? Or could they have squeaked out 6 more months  to see what happens.  And though I’m a firm believer in Apple’s products, I’m not unfamiliar with the chances that a bad egg can come down the pipe at anytime, and those who purchase the the macbook pro will be bitching they wished they had bought a G4 powerbook.  So it’s a gamble, and Apple’s been fairly straightfoward with running out new machines or updates every 6 months.  So chances are, by June there will be a macbook home with similar specs as today’s announcement, for $600 less.  And on a side note, I’m guessing someone of Jason Kottke’s stature <em>just might get their exchange</em>.</p>
                <p>And if not, Jason, we can talk when you’re ready to sell that g4 used….</p>

                <p>Now that he’s made more mainstream news cycles, I’ve refrained from posting much on the Hammer.  But I feel this news is worthy of a shout from the cliff, as it signals to me the pressure from within the party is doing exactly what I said they would do…use him up and throw him on hte scrap heap.  He will probably lose his primary in March, as I’d guess the republican machine will throw their money behind his competitor, hoping he’ll have a better chance against a democrat in the fall.  From there, he can be a fall guy for the Abramhoff deal, along with Ney, probably taking a bullet or two for several other republicans.  So this story is FAR from over, and the dominos have yet to get primary players, but one can only hope the truth <em>mostly</em> comes out.</p>

                  Hmmm.  Interesting rant.  Also curious as to why the author is using XHTML, <em>transitional</em>  Note, this site <em>used to</em>be valid, but as a user of the Alpha Squible theme, it currently isn’t.  That will change with either a switch to the impending beta, or a totally new design.</p>

                <p>Incase you missed it, Democrats and two Republicans, Mike DeWine and Lincoln Chafee, stood their ground, and managed to keep ANWR off the defense bill.  Pete Dominenici of New Mexico (?) has already vowed to add it to a filibuster proof budget bill in the spring, one I’m sure that will be full of all kinds of pork barrel projects.  So warm up that keyboard and start writing your represenatives, and voice your opinion, be it on ANWR, or the President spying on fellow Americans.</p>
