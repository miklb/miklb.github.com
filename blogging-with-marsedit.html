    <meta name="description" content="So I’ve been looking at some Mac OS X apps, for various tasks.  I’ve started using RSS more and more, and I’m not too keen on the Sage extension for FireFox.  Mainly because of screen real estate on the ol’ ibook.  NetNewsWire seems to be the choice, and through that, I’m playing with Mars Edit, a blogging app.  So this is my fist attempt at blogging outside the web interface.  If it works out, it may be an easier way to post, if nothing more than the built in spell check.  We’ll see about the other features.  Downside is it’s not a free app, so it better well prove to invaluable, or when its trial runs out, to the curb with it." />
