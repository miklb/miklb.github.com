                <p><a href="http://www.votejan.com/">Jan Schneider for Congress</a>Just a note to any readers in  Congressional district 13, to support Jan Schneider in her attempt to take the seat vacated by Katherine Harris.  I’ve gotten several emails pushing for her support, and come across a couple of blog posts as well, so I took a minute to check out her credentials.  Not your soccer mom got bored, or super rich white girl with nothing better to do type of candidate.  It’s also my understanding that a recent Democrat convert is being supported by the DNC.  I hope that’s not the case, and all because one may have a few more dollars than the other.  Shame shame.</p>
                <p>I’d love to know more about this one, so if you have any details, do share.</p>

                <p>So, just over a year ago I started blogging.  I believe I’ve grown quite a bit in my web knowledge in a short time of actually using a site I’ve started.  I tried doing something with just about every free resource out there, it just never “took”.  It wasn’t until my friend over at <a href="http://www.tinylittledots.com">tiny little dots</a> adopted WordPress, and thus I installed it on my newly purchased domain, did the light go on.  At once I felt at home.  I immediately begin cramming massive amounts of CSS knowledge into my already crowded head. I now can I say I can see myself actually putting food on the table and a roof over my head some day doing this stuff full time.  I’ve got a long way to go, and need to particularly see where I “fit in”, but it is quite exciting, a feeling I lost quite some time ago in regards to cooking.</p>
                <p>So a hardy thank you to tiny for adopting WP and to <a href="http://www.7milesdown.com/wp/">trench</a> for my first blogroll link.  Also a big thanks to the many people who’ve stopped by and left a comment, it’s always nice to know someones reading the site :)</p>
                <p>I’m really looking forward to seeing what the next year of doing this brings, what direction things will go, but if the first was any indication, it’s going to be great.</p>
