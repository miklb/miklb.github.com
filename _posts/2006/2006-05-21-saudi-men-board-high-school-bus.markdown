I'm not quite sure what to make of this, but I have to agree, the substitute driver should have had better training in how to handle riders that seem not to be students.  However, I can also understand the level of concern, and truthfully feel the authorities are handling this in the proper manner.  I don't care if they are Saudi or not, two adults boarding a high school bus, and not showing complete remorse when told of what they've done requires further investigation.  I'm not a fan of racial profiling to say the least , however, in today's climate, all precaution should be taken.  And as I said, any adult not showing remorse sends a signal to me.  You have to think the driver and students were on the edge of their seat the whole ride, and were happy to see  swarm of police when they arrived at school.  What I hope not to see is a rash of law suits from well to do parents claiming negligence on the drivers part.  That will accomplish nothing, but strap an already over burden school system with legal fees and potentially worse.

Clearly something needs to be clarified about how to handle similar situations, and at least in this area, better training and incentives for drivers need to be in place, as anytime something "scary" or worse happens, its a substitute driver at the wheel.
