Now, don't get me wrong, I despise the Rove machine, and all it stands for.  Which really however, is the root of what Jon Stewart said this evening about the Rove/Plame "scandal", and that is, it's not really about legality issue, its just another example of how this administration on the surface says and does one thing (see videotapes of Rove being interviewed, denying any involvement at all, McClellan vehemently denying any White House involvement, Bush's statement about firing leaks), then under the surface the White House was involved, Rove did have a hand in it, and  Bush has  no intention of firing, not to mention even distancing himself from those involved (see the smirk on Rove's face today exiting Air Force One with Bush).  All the allegations of back room deals, war for oil, all come rushing to the surface when situations such as this occur.  The logical conclusion has to be that if they are capable of lies about outing a CIA agent, or if not out right outing (we still don't know who the first Novak source is) then why wouldn't someone believe that Cheney really did have closed door meeting with the  energy companies, or that the administration really did have a plan before 9.11 to invade Iraq, and that contracts with Halliburton were already in place?  As the old saying goes, where there's smoke, there's fire.
