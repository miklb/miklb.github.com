So it seems that some early voters in S Florida are having issues with their electronic voting machines.  They tap one candidate, but the other shows on the screen you get to review your choices.  The kicker is that what is being reported in the media is that all incidences are voters who are choosing Davis, yet Crist is showing on the review page.  No media reports that I've seen mention the reverse, nor has anyone reported the issue with other offices up for election.  As the Miami Herald article says, this will really get the tin foil cap wearing crowd frothing at the mouth, perhaps this time with cause.
