Seems the Bush administration has appointed someone who is actually listening, and taking action in preserving our national parks.  I strongly believe the parks should be restricted in the use of motorized vehicles, for many reasons.  I can only hope the draft is taken as it stands, and I intend on adding my comments formally, as there’s a 90 day window to do so.  I’ll update after I make my voice heard." />
