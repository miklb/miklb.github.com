I no longer am cooking for a living, not going to school, and trying to make a go of it doing web design/consulting.  Thinking back on it all, I’ve come a long way, and look forward to where things go.  To any and all who’ve visited and commented, thanks.  I’ve recently tried to blog more in general, and also realized that the site is in need of some overhauling, as I’ve not really done much with the design/updating in almost a year.  So as soon as I crank out a new design for <a href="http://www.tinylittledots.com">Tiny Little Dots</a>, I’ll focus some spare time on the site.</p>

I first noticed it last week, when more updates were coming through in Google Reader.  Then yesterday, I really noticed full feeds with images for the software and better descriptions.

                <p>I had heard that <a href="http://site.gravatar.com">Gravatar 2.0</a> had been released, but hadn’t really paid much attention.  Today, while doing a little housekeeping around the site, I noticed that none of my gravatars were showing up.  After doing a little investigating, I realized it had to do with caching, among other things.  First thing I did was dump the cache on my gravatars folder in wp-content.  Second, I logged into the gravatar site, and re-associated my gravatar with my email that I use for that account.  Still no gravatars, mine, or anyone else’s.</p>
                <p>So I looked at the settings on Skippy’s gravatar plugin (which I like as I can set a local gravatar, vs using a default one from the original site), it was set to use caching.  I turned that setting off, and voilá, gravatars are showing back up.  Hopefully that could help someone else (though, from reading a few blogs, and the comments on the main site, there’s no guarantees the main site will be with fail).</p>
