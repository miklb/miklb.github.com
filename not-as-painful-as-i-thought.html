      <p>So if anyone has an “old school” flickr account, they too received an email a while back saying that as of March 15th, they needed to merge with a yahoo id.  I had a yahoo id, which I never really use.  And like most people, they are probably a bit attached to their online identities.  Obviously, I use miklb where ever I can.  I was a bit upset at the prospect of losing my flickr account of /miklb.  Granted, the yahoo account I have is miklb.online, but somehow that just isn’t what I wanted.  So I procrastinated in making the switch.  Finally, today, I went about looking into it, as I didn’t want to get locked out of my moblog images.  (Currently, I do not have a cell service with a camera phone, but not all of those images are still on my old phone, anyway…) I went to the flickr account, and saw the “merge” accounts option.  I went to merge miklb with yahoo id miklb.online.  No go.  miklb.online was already associated with flickr.  Ugh.  When did I do that?</p>

<p>So looking at that account, I hadn’t actually uploaded any images, so I saw I could delete the flickr account for that ID.  I didn’t know if I could then re-associate it, but what the heck, I figured I’d give it a shot.  I deleted the yahoo id from flickr, and tried again to merge, still thinking I’d become miklb.online.  In the meantime, I found a flickr export app for the Mac, <a href="http://sunkencity.org/flickrbackup/">Flickrbackup</a>, grabbed my images just in case, and then made the association between the old school account and the yahoo id.  All went smooth, and to my surprise, I get to keep the miklb account, I simply now log in with the yahoo id.  Excellent.  Perhaps this will move me to use flickr a bit more, I know I’d love to get a friend of mine to use it, but he’s a myspacer, and I don’t even know what he’s using to host his images.  (Goody Goody, I’ll even set you up with a blog if you make the switch from myspace).
So, long story short, it was far less painful to make the switch, and if you haven’t done so, fret not, if you have to be pumpkinpatch6969 instead of your favorite handle, you’ll not loose your flickr name.</p>
