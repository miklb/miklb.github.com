One of the few design skills I would truly like to fully understand and be able to employ in my work is the ability to choose and use type properly. Tonight I stumbled upon a post on the TypeKit blog sharing a pdf of a previously for sale book on the subject. While it is unfortunate that publisher didn't succeed, it is generous of the author to share it with the public. Head over to the blog to get a digital copy of [Pocket Guide to Combining Typefaces](http://blog.typekit.com/2016/04/29/combining-typefaces-free-guide-to-great-typography/). If you have other resources, please send them my way.
