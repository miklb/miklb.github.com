    <meta name="description" content="I’ve long been a fan of David Seah, but something he wrote today really resonated with me in relation to getting things done.I was armed with a new insight from The Now Habit: say “I choose” instead of “I have to”. When I say “I choose”, I am putting myself in charge of MY OWN MISSION and rising above whatever primordial slug-like fears lurk in the darkest recesses of my psyche.I often recall a similar exercise a wise man shared with me. He handed me a tennis ball and asked me to “try” and throw it. I easily tossed it across the room. He retrieved the ball and handed it back to me. He said, “no, try and throw it.”At this point I was confused. I just had. So I threw the ball with a bit more force. His response was the same. Finally, he told me, “you either throw it or you don’t. There is no in between. The next time you say ‘I am trying’, remember the ball.”This was all in response to a conversation about me saying I was trying to be a better boss/boyfriend/person.Tomorrow I will choose to be a better partner/boyfriend/person." />
