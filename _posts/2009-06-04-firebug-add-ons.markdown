I've recently been using Safari 4 beta, mostly because I had been too lazy to get more RAM, and Firefox was just too damn slow with all the apps I'd have open on only 1 gig.  Now that I'm at 4 gigs, I've been contemplating going back to Firefox, especially with the comments I've been reading about the speed improvements of the next version (3.5??).  Another reason I've been contemplating going back to Firefox is that Firebug is just far superior to Safari's built in inspector.  To that end, I've recently come across two add-ons for Firebug.

The first, <a href="http://robertnyman.com/firefinder/">Firefinder</a>, is a handy tool to "find HTML elements matching chosen CSS selector(s) or XPath expression".

The second is one that <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/06/introducing-page-speed.html">Google previously used internally</a>.  Today they open sourced it and released, <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/">Page Speed</a>.  Page Speed allows developers to "evaluate the performance of their web pages and to get suggestions on how to improve them."
