I admit I too have a fascination with mid-century food stuffs. I have several boxes of those little recipe books put out by various companies pimping their products. I also have a hand-bound collection of recipes from magazines that I thrifted. Might need to dust off the scanner and start sharing some after seeing this site.

Looks like the perfect tool for those who want to help write documentation but are put off by a particular markup (read, Mediawiki).

If you are on a Mac, use Markdown and don't have these, get them now.

Another brilliant idea for over night guests. Or a brunch party. Just add pitchers of sangria and mimosas.

This is a pretty big deal. Finally the government is holding big business responsible for food safety via felony charges directed at those at the top of the, ehem, *food chain*.
