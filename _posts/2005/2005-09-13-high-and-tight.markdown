I'm not quite sure 'ol John is really a baseball fan.  I'm sure George Will could give a few better analogies than calling balls and strikes if he's looking to paint himself as a straight shooter.  Anyone who watches baseball knows that sure, there's a strike zone, but every home plate umpire calls a slightly different strike zone.  And some call a different strike zone for veteran players than rookies.  Jeter doesn't neccessarily get the called third strike that Julio Lugo does.  And one guy may call low and outside a strike after the third, and another gives the pitcher a wider strike zone.  So therein lies the question Mr Roberts, <em>where is <strong>your</strong> strike zone</em>?  Are you going to give the pitcher the outside pitch, or are you going to call 'em high and tight?
