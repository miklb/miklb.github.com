<a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html">del.icio.us: y.ah.oo!</a>
So the 'net is abuzz that the hot tagging service del.icio.us was bought by yahoo.  Read through the comments, some are skeptical, some simply full of congrats, some outright damning the merger.  Me, eh, I'll wait to see what happens, but will start trying to get <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/">scuttle</a>    working again, just in case.  I've been using <a href="http://www.blinklist.com">Blinklist</a> as well, and there's no shortage of options out there, if yahoo does get too hands on.  I really don't see it as this commenter <blockquote>What happened to the decentralization the internet was supposed to be so good for?</blockquote>because, as I've said, there are other options out there, and will continue to grow, especially after this buy-out.
