Lately I've been contemplating switching to Safari, as Firefox still seems to be a memory hog, especially since I tend to leave my desktop on for days at a time.  With the improvements to the developer tools in Safari 4, there's less and less reason for me to hang on to Firefox.  Couple that with this <a href="http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Design">bookmarklet suite of design/development tools</a> I just discovered, and the excuse of having to use Firefox for it's superior developer tools flies right out the window.  

The suite includes a configurable <strong>grid</strong> overlay, a <strong>ruler</strong> overlay, a <strong>measurement</strong> tool to determine distance between two points, and a cursor <strong>crosshair</strong> tool (I've not found how to use this one effectively, but it could be useful for figuring placement when using position: absolute).

I can't speak to how Firebug and the Safari tools compare regarding javascript, as I don't do much with javascript, save using various jquery plugins.
