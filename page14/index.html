                <p>I’m not sure why it’s taken me this long to truly discover Band of Horses.  I’d owned Infinite Arms for a while, just hadn’t really listened to it.  Perhaps it was the fact that <em>Funeral</em> is on the jukebox of my favorite dive bar, and the girlfriend of one of my close friends played it over and over after he committed suicide.  What ever the case, I’ve recently been digging into their music and lyrics, and the vibe they put out really is speaking to me these days.</p>
                <p>This live acoustic version of <em>Factory</em> is a perfect example.  They were recently on Austin City Limits (The National were on the same show), and now I really want to experience them live.  Several years ago they played a SPoT show at the outdoor amphitheater in the Cuban Club, and from my porch in Ybor Heights I could hear them great.  The band shell seemed to direct the music right over the interstate onto my porch.  But I simply didn’t have the same appreciation for their sound as I do today.  Can’t wait for them to get back from Europe and travel the states again.</p>

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>I clicked over to CNN this evening to catch the Bachmann response to the President’s State of the Union speech.  It’s the car crash scenario - no matter how ugly it is, you can’t look away.  What got me though was this line, “yet this picture immortalizes the victory of young GIs over the incursion against the Japanese,” as she had the iconic image of the Marine’s raising the US flag.</p>
                <p>Wait, did I hear that right? The “incursion <strong><em>against</em></strong> the Japanese”? I rewound the DVR 3 times to make sure I didn’t hear her wrong. Nope, she went on to say, “to symbolize all of America coming together to beat back a totalitarian aggressor.” What totalitarian aggressor does she think they fought back?  Hitler?</p>
                <p>Listening to the pundits afterward, the only thing they talked about was the oddness of a second, “unofficial” Republican response. Or the fact that the camera that CNN used wasn’t the one that Bachmann was looking into.  DID YOU NOT HEAR HER REWRITE WORLD WAR II HISTORY?</p>
                <p>So I thought, maybe I didn’t hear her say that, and sought out to check. Nope, sure enough, CNN has a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/01/25/sotu.response.bachmann/">transcript of the Bachmann response</a>, and it’s right there.</p>
                <p>Check the video yourself, (do yourself a favor and fast forward to the 5:45 mark).</p>

                <p>While looking for this, I also read that earlier today she also rewrote some other American history by saying the founding fathers fought to end slavery.   You know, by getting them counted as 3/5 a person and all.</p>
                <p>I’d be very curious to hear what a Tea Party veteran, particularly a WWII vet has to say about their official spokesperson saying they helped save the Japanese.</p>

                  An Epiphany: How to Finally Resurrect  My Cooking Blog
      </a>
              </h1>
              <time datetime="2011-01-24T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">24 Jan 2011</time>
              <div class="e-content">
                <p>There are probably 6 of you who know me either in real life or online who read my tweets/blog that know that A)I was a chef in another life, B) I have a cooking blog.</p>
                <p>Every 9 months or so, I get these grand ambitions to resurrect the blog, but my grandiose visions overwhelm the realities of my daily life, and they never transpire.  That’s not to say that I don’t still love food, that I don’t <strong>every day</strong>  in my current profession as a guy who makes and manages web sites (do they still call it webmaster?) use my experiences as a chef, both in the work place dealing with people and changing focus at the drop of a dime, as well as the art itself.  It’s ephemeral, here today, gone in 20 minutes, a delicate balance between art and science.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/2658524899"><img alt="Still Life-ish" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3154/2658524899_0cc07183aa.jpg" class="right" /></a></p>
                <p>The epiphany is, keep it simple stupid.  It may not surprise 4 of you 6 that I read weekly the Miami Herald, NY Times, Chicago Tribune, LA Times food sections as well as our local über cool food writer Jeff Houck.  Not to mention the many tweets and links that come through my streams weekly.  I often want to share these, with a short anecdote, or comment.  <epiphany> That's what a couple of my favorite bloggers - Gruber and Kottke - do already</epiphany>.  It was really the basis of blogging 6-7 years ago.  Then, just maybe then, I won’t feel the overwhelming (self imposed) pressure to write long form. Those can just occur naturally.</p>
                <p>My question to the 3 of you still reading this? I should probably not push these to my regular Twitter account, right? I should just tell folks about the re-positioning once it’s done, and let them subscribe to the feed. Possibly create a new Twitter account to push those updates to those who prefer to use Twitter instead of Atom feeds for updates?  Should I link directly to the source article, ala Gruber, or simply link in the post with my anecdote ala Kottke?</p>
                <p>And full disclaimer, I do have advertising on that site, that despite it’s languishing in purgatory, pays for a significant amount of my hosting costs.  That has nothing to do with my desire to kick start the site however, but just want to be clear, ads will continue on the site.</p>

                <p>When you’re the son of Steve Earle and your name sake is Townes Van Zandt, you’ve got some pretty big shoes to fill.  Listening to his last two albums, especially the latest, <cite>Harlem River Blues</cite>, I think he’s stepped into them quite nicely.  He’s playing live at the Crow Bar in Ybor tonight. If you don’t have plans, you should now.</p>

Regularly during the baseball season Olbermann waxes on both current and past baseball events on his Baseball Nerd blog.  I’m not sure I’ve read a better example than his latest <a href="http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/11/this_just_infrom_1894.html">This Just In…From 1984</a>, showing a possibly never before seen page from a periodical of the time with images of a long lost championship game.  The fact he can give players names and anecdotes for many of those involved lends to the grainy images from a bygone era.  The juxtaposed image from the periodical with one of his own snapshots from the ‘09 World Series truly brings the past and present of baseball together brilliantly (despite it being the Yankees).  I highly recommend subscribing to the blog if you are a true lover of baseball.</p>
