        <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/mattel_football.jpg" class="right" alt="mattel_football" />I must have worn out at least 3 of Mattel’s little hand held football games when I was a kid.  Probably had another 2 confiscated from teachers for playing it during class.</p>

<p>So it’s no surprise that I’m stoked to see that there is a game for the iPhone heavily influenced by said handheld, and it’s <strong>free this weekend</strong> to boot.  <a href="http://www.touchgrove.com/">TouchGrove</a> is offering their version based on the game, (oh yeah, there was a sequel that was kick butt) until February 2.  Normally only $0.99, this seems like a great marketing plan, as they offer several other games based on similar hand held devices.  For instance I wouldn’t have known that they are working on a baseball game based on a similar handheld which I totally will buy!</p>

        <p>I’ve thoroughly enjoyed resurrecting this blog over the past 2 months, all the while trying to find the motivation to start food blogging again.  However, the more I search for that motivation, the more I’m drawn to the idea of further consolidating my blogging efforts to this single domain.  It’s not as if I get a huge amount of traffic on my cooking content anyway, and what little there is, should easily migrate over much like bloggingmeta’s traffic did with a permanent redirect.</p>

<p>One idea I had was to see if I’d do more food blogging by simply posting them to this site first, without migrating the old content, but if I were to succeed in my experiment, I’d find myself in a similar predicament in that I’d have no way to migrate back to the food blog, not to mention I’d potentially be penalizing myself in regards to search engine <em>stuff</em>.</p>

<p>The primary obstacle is how to migrate the content.  I highly doubt my code-fu would allow me to write a Habari-to-Habari importer by myself, though I’ve not even looked at any of the importers.  I’m not as worried about comments, so I’ve got some too-ashamed-to-disclose hacks I’m contemplating to overcome the importing dilemma.  If anyone wants to help with this goal, I’ll contribute as much as I can to making a formal Habari migration plugin.</p>

<p>Once I were to overcome that obstacle, the goal then would be to design a magazine-ish style theme that would allow for sections based on tags.  As I find myself blogging more and more about the iPhone, I’ve been <a href="http://twitter.com/miklb/status/1157627875">concerned</a> that it might turn off the few readers I have.  Building on the tag based sections would also allow me to better offer tag based feeds—though I don’t know if it’s possible to create a feed by excluding a tag ;-).  I’m sure I could easily redirect the feed from the cooking site to a /atom/tag/food (or what ever the structure is).</p>

<p>So I’m hoping that one of the 25 odd subscriber/readers might have an opinion on such a move in both how it might effect me search engine wise, and what your opinion would be on having such a diverse amount of content.</p>

        Freshbooks, Getting Customer Service Right
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2009-01-31T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">31 Jan 2009</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/freshbooks.jpg" alt="Freshbook" class="right" />First off, this isn’t meant as a review of <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/subscribe.php?ref=ef40c79726025-1">Freshbooks</a>.  Suffice to say, I’ve tested many of the online services for billing and time tracking; Freshbooks provides <strong>me</strong> the best solution for <strong>my</strong> needs.  Often though i’ts the intangibles that allow a business to rise above the rest.  For Freshbooks, their customer service certainly is the case.</p>

<p>Some time during this past fall my Paypal credit card number changed, probably due to losing it, I’m not exactly sure of the circumstances.  Subsequently, many of the services that I use for business, (hosting, domain registration, etc) were effected.  In the case of Freshbooks, I was in an arrangement where I was sub contracting with an individual, getting paid flat rates for the work I was doing, so I didn’t have an immediate need to update the account, unlike say, hosting.  Plus, I tend to be lazy and procrastinate, so it was easy for me to put it off.  Each month, I’d get an email saying that the card had been declined, and I’d say to myself, “I really need to update that,” and then <s>forget to</s>, blow off logging in and updating.</p>

<p>I ended the previous arrangement earlier this month, around the time I got another one of the reminder emails.  They really are reminders, not nagging or harsh in the least.  I went to log in, and was redirected to a page where I could change/update the contact info, as well the CC#.  However, I didn’t know exactly how much I owed, and since I’m trying to stick to a budget for my web development endeavors, I wanted to know exactly what I owed and plan accordingly—pay it all off or make a couple installment payments.  Never did I entertain the idea of just starting a new account or moving.</p>

<p>First thing the next morning (I sent the email to support around 9pm EST, which they are on also) I received an email from <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/our-team.php#laleh">Laleh</a> informing me that she had removed the suspended status from my account, rolled me back to their free account in which I could upgrade to a paid plan, and deleted my client list.  Mind you, clients and projects are never really deleted, rather it’s like a super-archived status.  At any time, you can undelete the client/project, and all of the information remains intact.</p>

<p>They could have easily charged me for the months since the last payment or some portion there of, after all, they were storing my data and settings.  I was fully prepared to pay for this, as my time is valuable, and re-entering client information and setting up the payment gateway again would take a fair amount of time.  Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with the outcome, and an even bigger fan of Freshbooks.</p>

<p>Ironically, <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/our-team.php#sunir">Sunir</a>, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at Barcamp Orlando (which Freshbooks was a sponsor of, yet another reason to be a fan) posted an article on their blog today about the <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2009/01/30/google-proves-saas-is-hard-even-for-big-guys/">difficulty of Saas</a>.&lt;blockquote&gt;SaaS is not just a new distribution method for software with a lovely revenue stream. It’s a new social contract with the customer that we all have to live up to, whether we’re companies big or small.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Freshbooks more than lived up to their contract, and continue to set the bar for how companies do business on the web.</p>

    <div class="e-content">
        <p>Prior to my discovery that you can post to a <a href="http://miklb.com/posting-with-iphone">Habari blog with Safari on the iPhone</a>, I purchased <a href="http://illuminex.com/iphone/iblogger/">iBlogger</a> for the iPhone.  It’s from the same developers of ecto, a desktop blogging client.  It’s currently only <strong>priced at $0.99</strong>, which for me is a price I’m willing to pay to test an app.  It supports all of the popular blogging platforms, as well as the generic metaweblog API, for which Habari has a plugin available.</p>

<p>Connecting the app to my Habari install was very easy, if I recall it even auto discovered the endpoint (example.com/xmlrpc).</p>

<p>As far as functionality, I do not know if because the generic metaweblog API is being used, and sites using engines like Moveable Type or WordPress, but the options are currently pretty sparse (as of v 1.0.7).  Habari’s plugin doesn’t support posting images, so the only options really are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>adding your location</strong> - the app inserts a link which opens to a Google map</li>
<li><strong>adding links</strong> - an easy UI for adding a hyperlink.</li>
<li><strong>tagging</strong> - this "feature" seems very weak.  It doesn't pull the existing tags from the site, a common feature in desktop blogging clients, and in my testing, keeps the previous post's tags on subsequent posts.  Might be handy if you expect to tag all of your on-the-go posts the same thing, but I don't see it that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>iBlogger does support multiple blogs, otherwise, I have not found any additional elements.  For $0.99, I suppose one can’t complain.  Since all of my personal sites are on Habari, I haven’t had cause to look at any of the other iPhone blogging clients.  I understand the WordPress app is free and open-sourced, I’m sure at some point, most likely out of boredom, I will look at it.  Ultimately, as many people have pointed out, typing on the iPhone doesn’t lend itself to the phone being a real blogging device.</p>

<p>However to get that in the moment feel, having a stable option with with a decent feature set would be nice to have.  Thank goodness with Habari and in iPhone, you don’t need a secondary app.</p>

<p>Holy cow, I can even post from the Flickr silo!</p>

<p>This kinds blows my mind. Certainly not a primary mode of blogging, but to be able to take a photo with the camera, upload to Flickr, then write a blog post is kinda amazing.</p>

<p><em>Edit (not via iPhone)</em> To be clear, my amazement isn’t in the iPhone, rather, in the quality of design and code of Habari that it just <strong>works</strong>, even in the mobile Safari browser.</p>
