In my case, I was seeing hundreds of blank lines creating the page navigation at the top of the page. It doesn’t affect what the visitor sees, but for developers who use Jekyll poor source is a bad practice. Also imagine someone new to Jekyll and HTML in general trying to view source to debug an issue. Turns out the problem is with the Liquid template language Jekyll uses. Seems the Liquid community have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/216&quot;&gt;discussing the issue&lt;/a&gt; for 3 years without a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first approach to solving this was to use a Ruby gem &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier&quot;&gt;HTML Beautifier&lt;/a&gt;. It works great, but for a site like mine with over 500 posts with a lot of tag pages, it increases the build time exponentially. To the point I’ve seen Travis time out due to the long process. Today I went looking for another solution and stumbled upon this &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kerotaa/5788650&quot;&gt;gist - remove empty lines&lt;/a&gt;. It concerned me the plugin would increase the build time in Jekyll vs in Travis, but was pleasantly surprised it added no noticeable overhead and produces much cleaner HTML output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I get quick build times and cleaner source.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, I still sought out whether there was a way to organize them by at least year within that single folder. I’ve been blogging for 11 years this spring, and while sporadic at times, that is still a lot of posts. When I need to reference a new one, or look for something from the past, having them by year would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr yes, you can arbitrarily organize under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; folder however you want. All Jekyll looks for are markdown files with FrontMatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I also learned, and isn’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is that you can create top level folders each with their own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; sub-folder and Jekyll will read from each one, appending that folder name to the generated url for the post, i.e. a folder &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2016-04-26-post-title&lt;/code&gt; would yield a URL of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com/foo/post-title&lt;/code&gt; (varying by your permalink structure). Those top level folders are then treated as categories, allowing for more filtration within your templates and site organization. I can see other ways of using them, especially as I continue to move towards a more indieweb way of doing things and more tweets originating from this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to contribute my discoveries to the official documentation as soon as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been toiling the past year or so trying to shoehorn my brain into Omnifocus to no avail, so at the beginning of the year I started exploring other methods. About 2 weeks ago, my brain just started to work in regard to using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taskpaper.com&quot;&gt;TaskPaper&lt;/a&gt;. If you aren’t familiar with TaskPaper, it is a plain text method of tracking todos that has tools built around it to filter by tags and projects. I’ve owned the app for awhile, but not until 3.0 was in beta did things begin to click within the app organizing projects. I always wanted (wrongly) to keep separate files for each project. Maybe that is one thing I learned using Omnifocus was structuring projects. Now everything personal is one single text file. I do have a separate one for the free lance work I’m doing because that’s a different mode. I don’t want to be distracted by anything when I’m trying to mow through items for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other element of my productivity was how to keep and better use Reminders.app and Siri. I knew TaskPaper had Applescript support, so that was the first place I looked. Sure enough, I found a script that would import from Reminders to TaskPaper. Unfortunately, TP3 changed it’s scripting method to new JXA, so the old Applescripts were not compatible. Luckily, someone did the work before I fried synapses trying to learn more advanced methods of JXA. A thread in the support forums,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/appending-items-to-a-taskpaper-file-using-siri/1456/9&quot;&gt;Using Siri&lt;/a&gt; covered exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, I devised the idea of having an “Inbox” for Siri and a corresponding list for TP. I also have a Grocery List and my main reminders is for timed items. I prefer Apple’s reminders because it’s nag is truly a nag. If something &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be done on a certain day, it will sit on the lock screen of my phone. I can snooze it for an hour if it’s not time sensitive, and if it really can wait, I can put off until next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can say, “Hey, Siri, add build a robot to my inbox” and she will. Later, I can run the script which will migrate (including deleting) the reminder to an Inbox in TaskPaper, which I can move to an appropriate project or create a new one if it is warranted. My next goal is to set up a cron job on the always-on iMac to run the script every night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For iOS, I’ve tried a few different apps for TaskPaper, but it seems &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?at=10lKmy&quot;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt; is going to stick. Also, I’ve not given up on Omnifocus for long term project tracking or potentially work related where contexts and due dates might be necessary, something OF excels at. An upcoming update to &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?at=10lKmy&quot;&gt;Omnifocus for iOS&lt;/a&gt; will vastly expand on the URL schemes, and there is already a demo using &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?at=10lKmy&quot;&gt;WorkFlow&lt;/a&gt; to build projects in OF from TaskPaper formatted lists in Editorial. Sounds snazzy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all my new system isn’t that fancy or original, but again, that’s the trap of chasing productivity, apps and systems. They become complicated and burdensome to the point you abandon them for the next shiny object, never truly doing the stuff you really wanted to keep track of in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope when I visit this in the fall, I’ve not made many changes and can focus on what I’ve accomplished over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

Suffice to say, I’m in that boat all to well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current editor of choice is &lt;a href=&quot;http://atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;. It’s open source and more than fits the customization itch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from deciding on which packages to use (I’ve
&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/users/miklb/stars&quot;&gt;starred the ones I use&lt;/a&gt;) the other element I’ve gone back and forth with is theme &amp;amp; syntax UI. I’ve long been a fan of both Solarized Light and Dark, but have finally settled on Atom Dark and &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/themes/oceanic-next&quot;&gt;Oceanic Next&lt;/a&gt;. I can also recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://olivermak.es&quot;&gt;Oliver Pattison’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/users/opattison&quot;&gt;Newbound syntax themes&lt;/a&gt; My dream font is Operator Mono, but until I can justify the purchase of that, I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://input.fontbureau.com/info/&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tweak I just discovered is for adjusting the font size in the panel, or the sidebar. I’d been able to easily make the font larger for code/markdown, but sometimes had to break the readers out to discern what file was what in a nested folder. To the rescue I found &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;atom-panel.tool-panel&lt;/code&gt; for just that. I’m currently using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.4em&lt;/code&gt;. Mind you this is on my old 11 inch Air. I’ve not had as much an issue on the iMac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tweak I’ve added to my custom &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;styles.less&lt;/code&gt; file is to italicize attributes. I’m also a fan of italicized comment blocks, which is included in the snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sass highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;atom-text-editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.entity.other.attribute-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.comment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure as I expand my development world, (I have a goal to learn python by &lt;a href=&quot;https://miklb.com/building-a-twitterbot&quot;&gt;Building a Twitterbot&lt;/a&gt; ) I’ll continue to tweak Atom, but for now, I’m as close to happy with an editor as I have ever been.
