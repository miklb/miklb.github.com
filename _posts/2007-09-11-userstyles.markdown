A few months ago, I came across <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme">Jon Hicks' Mac inspired Google Reader</a>, but recently noticed the version I was using was outdated, and Google Reader wasn't looking so hot.  Off I went in search of an update, and subsequent posts on Jon's site, found <a href="http://userstyles.org">User Styles</a>.  Though the site could use some better search functionality, I really like it in the sense that you can easily add styles via the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108">Stylish</a> extension for Firefox.  I've employed <a href="http://miklb.com/custom-style-sheets-and-basecamp">Stylish for BaseCamp</a>, and have thought more about how it could be used, User Styles gives plenty to think about now.
