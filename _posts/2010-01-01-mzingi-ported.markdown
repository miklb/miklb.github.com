I was pleasantly surprised this afternoon by a <a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi#comment-4323">comment left here on the site</a> that my first Habari theme, <a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi">Mzingi</a>, had been <a href="http://www.wolfcms.org/wiki/themes:start#mzingi">ported to another CMS, WolfCMS</a>.  Though I've since passed Mzingi off to the official Habari project, and is now owned by the community and part of the official download, it's a bit rewarding to see it deemed worthy of porting.  You can see a <a href="http://adajer.byethost5.com/wolf-themes">demo of it in action</a> as a WolfCMS theme.

It's also nice they gave attribution on the official site.  I'd not heard of the project before, seems like a young project that is a fork of another CMS project, but their site describes the project as something akin to Habari.
