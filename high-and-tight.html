    <meta name="description" content="‘Judges Are Not Politicians,’ Roberts SaysI’m not quite sure ‘ol John is really a baseball fan.  I’m sure George Will could give a few better analogies than calling balls and strikes if he’s looking to paint himself as a straight shooter.  Anyone who watches baseball knows that sure, there’s a strike zone, but every home plate umpire calls a slightly different strike zone.  And some call a different strike zone for veteran players than rookies.  Jeter doesn’t neccessarily get the called third strike that Julio Lugo does.  And one guy may call low and outside a strike after the third, and another gives the pitcher a wider strike zone.  So therein lies the question Mr Roberts, where is your strike zone?  Are you going to give the pitcher the outside pitch, or are you going to call ‘em high and tight?" />

                I’m not quite sure ‘ol John is really a baseball fan.  I’m sure George Will could give a few better analogies than calling balls and strikes if he’s looking to paint himself as a straight shooter.  Anyone who watches baseball knows that sure, there’s a strike zone, but every home plate umpire calls a slightly different strike zone.  And some call a different strike zone for veteran players than rookies.  Jeter doesn’t neccessarily get the called third strike that Julio Lugo does.  And one guy may call low and outside a strike after the third, and another gives the pitcher a wider strike zone.  So therein lies the question Mr Roberts, <em>where is <strong>your</strong> strike zone</em>?  Are you going to give the pitcher the outside pitch, or are you going to call ‘em high and tight?</p>
