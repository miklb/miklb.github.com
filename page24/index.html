<p>Holy cow, I can even post from the Flickr silo!</p>

<p>This kinds blows my mind. Certainly not a primary mode of blogging, but to be able to take a photo with the camera, upload to Flickr, then write a blog post is kinda amazing.</p>

<p><em>Edit (not via iPhone)</em> To be clear, my amazement isn’t in the iPhone, rather, in the quality of design and code of Habari that it just <strong>works</strong>, even in the mobile Safari browser.</p>

    <time datetime="2009-01-27T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">27 Jan 2009</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p><a href="http://satoridesigns.blogspot.com/2004/12/primus-sonic-youth-mudhoney-pavement.html"><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/redrocks_92_web.jpg" alt="ticketstub" class="right" /></a>For my second installment of <a href="http://miklb.com/tag/tunesday">Tunesday</a>, I thought I’d do a little reminiscing and highlight my single most favorite band of the ’90s, <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/Pavement-MP3-Download/10514495.html">Pavement</a>.  Certainly it’s always difficult to say “favorite band”, or “favorite song”.  Heck, its often difficult for me to say “top ten…”, but I can honestly say that Pavement is my favorite band from that time, and is still a band that gets heavy rotation.</p>

<p>I discovered Pavement in the fall of ‘92.  Discovered probably isn’t the best characterization, as I didn’t know who they were when I saw their name as the opening act for the incredible lineup of Mudhoney, Sonic Youth and Primus (it’s amazing what you can find with a Google search.  The ticket stub, complete with the relatively cheap price of $17.60 is from that show).  The show was at the legendary open air amphitheater Red Rocks.  I had moved to Denver that spring, and this was my first visit to the venue.  I was only familiar  with Red Rocks from the classic U2 concert video, <cite>Under a Blood Red Sky</cite>, but all of my friends in Denver spoke of it with reverence.  I was a huge fan of both Mudhoney and Sonic Youth (still am), and though not a zealot in regards to Primus like some, I had seen them earlier that year in a small club in Tampa and knew they’d be a nice way to end the evening and was really looking forward to the show.</p>

<p>Anyway, Pavement were setting up to open the show, and they really looked like a bunch of roadies who were a pick up band to just warm up the crowd.  A bunch of young guys, with this considerably older drummer who came out, stood on his stool, and in one fell swoop, dropped to a seated position and kicked off the first song.  It was love at first note.</p>

<p>Pavement is now considered one of the trailblazers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music">lo-fi sound</a>, along with bands like Sebadoh and the lesser known outfit <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Slint-Tweez-MP3-Download/10910132.html">Slint</a>.  Often coming across as dissonant and harmonic at the same time, with intelligent, sometimes cryptic lyrics, their dynamic sound is infectious. (And that’s where I stop trying to sound like a music writer. )</p>

<p>Pavement broke up somewhere around the fall of ‘99, but not before putting out 5 albums, and a slew of EPs, including my favorite of all their recordings, <cite>Watery, Domestic</cite>.  As far as must haves, their first two full length albums, <cite>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</cite> and <cite>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</cite> should be in every fan of ’90s, American indie rock library.  Of the last 3, it’s decidedly split amongst fans which were better, with me being in the <cite>Brighten the Corners</cite> camp.</p>

<p>Steve Malkmus continues to record and perform with his band the Jicks, and fellow guitarist Scott <em>“Spiral Stairs”</em> Kannberg has recorded a couple of albums with the band <cite>Preston School of Industry</cite>.  I quite enjoy <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Preston-School-Of-Industry-Monsoon-MP3-Download/10813493.html">Monsoon</a>, particularly the track <cite>Caught in the Rain</cite>.</p>

<p>I stumbled onto an interview recently with Malkmus in which he was asked about the possibility of a Pavement reunion, and he seemed to imply the door was open.  I’m not sure they’d be able to recapture the magic, or if it would just be a nostalgic trip down memory lane, but either way, I’d be one of the first in line to see it.</p>

<p>Pavement recorded all of their albums with the label Matador Records, and are all available, along with expanded re-releases of several of their albums at emusic.com. If you’d like an invite to emusic for a trial membership and 50 free downloads (you’ll have to give a CC#, but they don’t charge until after the first month), leave a comment with the email address you’d like it sent to, and I”ll send one your way. <em> Shameless confession - you can do a trial membership without the invite from me, but if you were to sign up with emusic after the trial via invite, I’d get a 50 song credit</em>.</p>

        <p>So my mac mini took a dirt nap on Friday, (I’ve yet to fully diagnose the problem, suffice to say it won’t boot, and I wasn’t able to find the hard drive in target disk mode) so I purchased a new iMac to replace it.  Unfortunately, iLife09 wasn’t installed on it, but I’d already read that I’d be eligible for a free upgrade.  Well, it seems iLife09 will be available tomorrow.  What sucks is that I’m going to have to pay the $10 for shipping and handling for the disc.  I can’t just go into the Apple Store with my receipt and get a copy that they will be dropping into boxes, even though I made the purchase 4 days prior to the release.  Certainly not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but as much as Apple prides itself on it’s retail experience, this seems to slip through the cracks.  Couple that with the less than obvious link to the page you actually need to claim your copy, and I start to get the feeling that they aren’t really making a priority to get the copy in the hands of owners of new machines.  From the <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/01/26ilife.html">press release</a>, it took me 3 more pages to actually find the link to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/uptodate/">qualify my purchase and upgrade</a>, which included going through the Apple Store.  Maybe rather than try to push MobileMe or a printer bundle, the salesperson could have provided me with this information?</p>

        <p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KYgjpL1TYxQ/SWr-EtMxm0I/AAAAAAAABV4/BqkqrCsiusA/s1600-h/Beard-Web3.jpg"><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/beardrevue.jpg" alt="beard poster" class="right" /></a>Last week I came across an interesting site, <a href="http://www.beardrevue.com/2008/01/beard-poster.html">Beard Revue</a>, and for the site’s 1 year anniversary, the author had created a print based on the classic <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=milton+glaser+bob+dylan">Milton Glaser <cite>Dylan</cite> print.</a>  Something about the print <em>spoke to me</em>.  Maybe I was caught in a melancholy mood thinking about my father, and how significant his beard was to me.  I’m not sure, but I ordered the print in one of those 2am browsing the web moments. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3222992778"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3222992778_f18e159065_s.jpg" class="left" /></a> I got an email from the author middle of the week saying the print had been shipped, and low and behold, today it arrived in the mail.  I’d like to start buying more original art like this.   I’ve been keeping my eye on <a href="http://20x200.com">20x200</a> for something to capture me, but a site with larger, affordable prints such as the beard revue would be a great find.  There’s something about opening the tube and smelling the ink that creates a much more personal connection to the artist.  I’d also add the little touch of using stamps on the tube also lends a personal touch, particularly in this case, where several different stamps are used.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you are a beard aficionado, you definitely want to check out Michael’s blog.</p>
