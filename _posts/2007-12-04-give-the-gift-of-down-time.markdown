Another six months, another disappointment in web hosting.  This time, the popular Media Temple grid-server.  For the past 2+ months, its been one problem after another, with the most recent being an 12 plus hour down time because of a <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/electrical-systems-maintenance-notice-nov-30th/">failed maintenance</a>.  They talk of credits for users, however I'm not seeing one in my account.  A company I work with received the email, however, not my personal account.  So on the heals of this debacle, they are offering <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/2007/12/04/give-the-gift-of-web-hosting/">gift  cards</a> for a years worth of hosting.  As if someone would want to give you a migraine for Christmas.

Nice timing Media Temple....
