              <p>Prior to my discovery that you can post to a <a href="http://miklb.com/posting-with-iphone">Habari blog with Safari on the iPhone</a>, I purchased <a href="http://illuminex.com/iphone/iblogger/">iBlogger</a> for the iPhone.  It’s from the same developers of ecto, a desktop blogging client.  It’s currently only <strong>priced at $0.99</strong>, which for me is a price I’m willing to pay to test an app.  It supports all of the popular blogging platforms, as well as the generic metaweblog API, for which Habari has a plugin available.</p>
              <p>Connecting the app to my Habari install was very easy, if I recall it even auto discovered the endpoint (example.com/xmlrpc).</p>
              <p>As far as functionality, I do not know if because the generic metaweblog API is being used, and sites using engines like Moveable Type or WordPress, but the options are currently pretty sparse (as of v 1.0.7).  Habari’s plugin doesn’t support posting images, so the only options really are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>adding your location</strong> - the app inserts a link which opens to a Google map</li>
                <li><strong>adding links</strong> - an easy UI for adding a hyperlink.</li>
                <li><strong>tagging</strong> - this "feature" seems very weak.  It doesn't pull the existing tags from the site, a common feature in desktop blogging clients, and in my testing, keeps the previous post's tags on subsequent posts.  Might be handy if you expect to tag all of your on-the-go posts the same thing, but I don't see it that way.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>iBlogger does support multiple blogs, otherwise, I have not found any additional elements.  For $0.99, I suppose one can’t complain.  Since all of my personal sites are on Habari, I haven’t had cause to look at any of the other iPhone blogging clients.  I understand the WordPress app is free and open-sourced, I’m sure at some point, most likely out of boredom, I will look at it.  Ultimately, as many people have pointed out, typing on the iPhone doesn’t lend itself to the phone being a real blogging device.</p>
              <p>However to get that in the moment feel, having a stable option with with a decent feature set would be nice to have.  Thank goodness with Habari and in iPhone, you don’t need a secondary app.</p>
