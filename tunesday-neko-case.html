              <p>Perhaps today’s Tunesday was inspired by the plethora of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nekocase">tweets</a> I’ve seen from her the past few days (to <a href="http://www.nekocase.com/auction/index.htm">raise money to help students with creative writing</a>), coupled with a beautiful woman I recently met giving me “bonus points” for liking Neko Case. Or it’s just that I love Neko Case’s voice.</p>
              <p>I’ve had a love affair with her voice for about 8 years, since I first heard <cite>Porchlight</cite> from the soundtrack to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266971/">Slaughter Rule</a>.</p>
              <p>At the time, I was working 100hr weeks, and rarely had time to find music outside of emusic.com, but I was able to get my hands on <cite>Furnace Room Lullaby</cite>.  And while I didn’t race out to buy more of her music, I often came back to that album.  A couple of years later <cite>Fox Confessor Brings the Flood</cite> was released, and if I wasn’t smitten (mind you, I’d probably never even seen her photo, it was purely the soul and emotion of her voice, not some school boy crush on a pretty face - though I now know that’s the case too).</p>
              <p><cite>Margaret vs Pauline</cite> immediately joined my heavy rotation list, and is still on one of my favorite play lists.  Since then I’ve acquired <cite>The Virginian</cite>, an earlier recording, as well as what I think is her latest recording, <cite>Middle Cyclone</cite>.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, by the time i discovered she was playing in Orlando a little over a year ago, the show was sold out.  I’m anxiously awaiting the next opportunity, in the meantime I leave you with <cite>Star Witness</cite> off of <cite>Fox Confessor Brings the Flood</cite>, from the aforementioned sold out show in Orlando, Florida December of ‘09.</p>
