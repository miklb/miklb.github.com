              <time datetime="2008-12-20T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">20 Dec 2008</time>
              <div class="e-content">
                <p>First, I’ve oft meant to write something about Twitter, specifically since I read <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2008/01/03/self-publishing-is-the-new-blogging/">Zeldman’s “Self Publishing is the New Blogging”</a>.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  And ch-ching was heard in the land. And the (not citizen) journalists heard it, and it got them pecking into their Blackberries and laptops.

And then the writers and designers, ashamed at rubbing shoulders with common humanity, discovered the 140-character Tweet and the Tumblr post. No stink of commerce, no business model, nothing that could even charitably be called content, and best of all, no effort. Peck, peck, send. 
                </blockquote>
                <p>I discovered “blogging” and the culture surrounding it just before what I assume is the time when “…(not citizen) journalists heard it…”.  It was an exciting discovery, which ultimately lead me to the career I (usually) enjoy now.  And as much I probably contribute to the <em>not citizen</em> “pecking at their Blackberries and laptops”, and as much as Twitter has long lost the purity of “not having a stink of commerce”, I personally enjoy the freedom of 140 character rants, without any concern whether anyone is reading them or not.  I use Twitter solely because there’s a certain cathartic release in firing off something like “trying to explain browser differences on form styling is like swimming in 3 day old mashed potatoes”.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that wasn’t the original intent of this post.  Rather, there really is another reason I enjoy Twitter.  It’s a compelling way to get a glimpse into the lives of people that you’ve crossed paths with and whom you find interesting or share common interests with, but haven’t had the opportunity to really get to know.</p>
                <p>Then something like today happens.  I’d been away from technology the last twenty four hours, and wanted a light hearted way of catching up with what was going on in the world, and the web in particular.  Plus, there’s always a few good laughs along the way (see <a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">@hotdogsladies</a>).</p>
                <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/cscott_twitter.jpg" alt="twitter" class="left" />Then this tweet came across Twitterific.  First, I’ve not really ever met either Chris or Sean.  <a href="http://iamzed.com/">Chris</a> I began following after he began following me at blogOrlando3.  I wasn’t even sure who he was until the brief encounter we had at the after party.  (Chris was the lucky guy handing out the drink tickets.  Everyone’s best friend for at least 5 minutes.)  Afterward I realized that he helped <a href="http://hyku.com/blog/">Josh Hallet</a> with the the conference.  I, like many people, truly enjoyed blogOrlando, the vibe surrounding it, and felt anyone who put that together or were involved I’d like to eventually get to know.  So I follow several people that were at blogOrlando, including Chris, Josh, and <a href="http://twitter.com/jharr">Jeremy</a>.</p>
                <p><a href="http://seancoates.com/">Sean</a> I first encountered in the Habari IRC channel when he came along looking for help with getting some patches committed so he could fix the s9y importer and migrate his blog to Habari.  Always excited for a new user/community member, I committed his patches, and soon noticed him hanging around the channel.  Long story short, Sean is now part of the PMC of Habari, and can commit his own damn patches  now ;-).</p>
                <p>My point?  I guess after writing this I don’t have something profound to say.  I’d just never seen a correspondence between Chris or Sean on Twitter in the time I’ve been following both.  Certainly I don’t know either well enough to know if they actually have met, which wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility for two developers (who also share a love of great beer, another reason I enjoy their tweets) to have met.</p>
                <p>But it gave me one of those smiles and six degrees of separation moments.</p>
                <p>Oh, did I mention it gave me a smile after a couple of shit weeks?</p>

                  Favorite Album of 2008: The Gaslight Anthem's The '59 Sound
      </a>

              <time datetime="2008-12-20T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">20 Dec 2008</time>
              <div class="e-content">
                <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/59sound_web.jpg" alt="The '59 Sound" class="right" />First, let me reiterate, it’s <em>my</em> favorite album of 2008, not a declaration that’s the <strong>best</strong> album of the year.  From the opening crackles of the old skool sound of a needle on vinyl on <cite>Great Expectations</cite> to the melancholy anthem-esque <cite>The Backseat</cite>, <cite>The ‘59 Sound</cite> is just a great listen all the way through.</p>
                <p>The album is ripe with all the things I turn to in the music I listen to regularly—whiskey and cigarette tinged vocals, driving bass lines, and jangly guitar riffs.  The subject of the lyrics tend to revolve around mortality, regret, and lost loves, without ever sounding like there’s no chance for redemption.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  But every slow mans song
Is a night I'd like to spend with you
Just twisting the night away

                <p>From <cite>Cassanova, Baby!</cite></p>
                <p>Critics of the Jersey based band have sighted the obvious Springsteen influences (think <cite>Nebraska</cite> era Springsteen, not <cite>Born in the U.S.A</cite>), which to me isn’t a bad thing.  However, they also have a punk tinged sensibility ala another band that’s still in heavy rotation in my music players, Lucero.  I lament having missed The Gaslight Anthem this fall when they passed through town, however, they are playing the <a href="http://www.langerado.com/2009/langerad09.php?sec=14">Langerado Festival</a> this year, which has a line up that reads like my 5 star ratings in iTunes.  Ryan Adams, Lucero, The Gaslight Anthem, The Pogues, Bad Brains, the list goes on.  I certainly hope to catch them in  a club on their way to or from the festival, as that’s really the environment I think they’d be best.  Packed, sweaty, and bourbon fueled.</p>

                <p>Several other albums were on my list of faves for ‘08.  Second place most certainly would go to The Hold Steady’s <cite>Stay Positive</cite> if for nothing other than the last track, <cite>Slapped Actress</cite>.  However, the whole album simply rocks.  Also on the short list would be the Brian Eno/David Byrne collaboration <cite>Listen Everything That Happens Will Happen Today</cite>.</p>
                <p>Other highlights for 2008 were Cat Power’s <cite>Jukebox</cite>, Drive by Trucker’s <cite>Brighter Than Creation’s Dark</cite>,  Okkervil River’s <cite>Stand In</cite>, Vampire Weekend’s <cite>Vampire Weekend</cite>, and Deerhunter’s <cite>Microcastle</cite>, though that last one was only recently released, and I’ve not listened to it a lot yet, but my initial thoughts are it’s a nice change of pace from my regular listening styles.</p>
                <p>Any indie albums at the top of your list for 2008 I should check out?  I’m always looking to discover new music (especially indie bands I can get from emusic).</p>

                  Calendar Syncing: Lightning, Google, iCal and Nokia e62
      </a>
              </h1>
              <time datetime="2008-12-07T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">07 Dec 2008</time>
              <div class="e-content">
                <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/sync.jpg" alt="sync" class="right" />I’m still railing against signing a contract with a cell carrier, so I haven’t purchased a new phone in some time, but the bigger need to have a more robust cell phone these days had me revive my Nokia e62.  All in all, it’s a pretty good phone, with a decent built in browser (based on Webkit if I recall) and works well with my existing pay as I go plan.  I even managed to coax an unlimited data plan out of AT&amp;T.  The e62 also plays pretty well with my Macs—bluetooth syncing of contacts and calendar, the Nokia Media manager will sync an iTunes folder directly to the phone, so a 2GB card gives me a decent amount of music for on the go.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I recently began using Thunderbird 3.0, aka Shredder, which is still pre beta.  That meant to really use it, I had to use the nightly build of Lightning, 1.0pre.  As with any Mozilla alpha product, you can expect most extensions to not work, which certainly is the case with these two.  I really like the combination, despite the occasional glitches, and wanted to find a way to sync Lightning with the phone.  What an adventure that turned out to be.</p>
                <p>Everything I found searching the web suggested using an extension for syncing the Google Calendar with Lightning, which obviously wasn’t compatible with these versions, and even testing it with the stable releases, I couldn’t get it to work, so off I searched for another way.  Enter <a href="http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/">GCALDaemon</a>, something I’d seen written about on several ocassions but had never quite investigated.</p>
                <p>Using the <a href="http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/usage12.html">Mac OS X installation</a> guidelines (installing in Applications vs usr/local/sbin), and being sure to use the the shell script config-editor definitely is the simplest way.  I’m certainly not a black belt in unix-fu, but following the instructions for <a href="http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/usage.html#top">syncing with Sunbird/Lightning</a> and the config-editor even I was able to get Lighting 1.0pre synced with a Google Apps calendar fairly effortlessly.</p>
                <p>The next step was to sync iCal (or so I thought) with the Google Calendar so I could then sync it with my phone.  I briefly toyed with GCALDaemon for that too, however my impatience led me to give Google’s <a href="http://code.google.com/p/calaboration/">Calaboration</a> tool a spin. Fortunately it was quick and painless, and I was soon syncing the same Google Apps calendar with iCal that was synced with Lightning.</p>
                <p>However (<em>there’s always a but, isn’t there</em>), I soon found out that you can’t sync from the phone’s calendar to a network calendar.  So anything I were to add to the phone, would need to be transferred to the network calendar.  I’m pretty lazy as it is, so adding a step like that seemed like a recipe for losing an important date.  For iPhone users, this also seems to be the case.  So now what?</p>
                <p>Another search turned up <a href="http://thenokiablog.com/2008/09/29/how-to-sync-google-calendar-apple-ical-and-nokia-phone-calendar/">this post on syncing a Nokia calendar with iCal and Google</a>, and suggested <a href="http://www.goosync.com/">Goosnyc</a>. I wasn’t keen on using a 3rd party service, but I figured I’d test it out at least, and see where it goes.  Their SMS to automate the sync settings never arrived, so I followed the <a href="http://www.goosync-forum.com/showthread.php?t=8">Nokia e61/e62 manual syncing</a> instructions, which were spot on (once I figured out that I needed to look in “Office” for the Sync settings), and within a few minutes, my Nokia e62 was synced to my Google Apps calendar which was synced to LIghtning and iCal.</p>
                <p>I still need to sort out a few minor issues with the phone now syncing with iCal, as I had some holiday calendars and what not synced to the phone, which then added the dates to the Google Calendar, so in iCal I was getting the same holidays showing up multiple times.  That’s easily remedied by not displaying those calendars, but conveniently gives me all of the holidays on the other calendars.  I also need to make sure that when I sync the phone to iCal, I don’t get duplicate entries in the local calendar, but again, I think I can get around that by simply creating a “phone” calendar, and hiding it in iCal.</p>
                <p>Goosync does require a manual sync to Google Calendar, but that’s less of a hassle than migrating entries from one calendar to the other.  All in all, I’m quite pleased now that I can add items directly from an email into my calendar, or right into my phone, and it will conveniently appear in all of my calendars.</p>
                <p>If anyone knows of a more seemless method, I’m all ears.</p>

                <p>Twitter Productivity.  Sounds like an oxymoron doesn’t it?  Well, with the recent announcement of <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/iwantsandy/topics/a_fork_in_the_road_an_important_announcement_about_i_want_sandy">i want sandy’s demise</a>, I came across a Twitter bot that actually seems like a productive tool for the Twitterer.  <a href="http://twitter.com/timer">Timer</a> allows you to simply follow it, in which it then follows you.  Then you simply send Timer a direct message to remind you of something upcoming, ie, d Timer 60 call client X.  You’ll then get a direct message 60 minutes later reminding you to call client X.  Seems it only recognizes minutes, so I’m not sure how efficient it is for reminding you of something past the short term, but it’s still an interesting tool.  Couple the concept with the fact that the developers of i want sandy are now working for Twitter, we might see similar type tools integrated into Twitter.</p>

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>As my online endeavors grow, I find myself with different sites floating around, doing nothing, as I have so many ideas for each site, I wind up not posting to any of them.  I originally started Blogging Meta because I thought I wanted to have a personal site, and a site that I could focus on tech related blogging.  Well, as I’ve said, neither came to fruition, and I’ve found myself lately feeling as if I had some dual personality that were just spinning their wheels.</p>
                <p>So tonight I decided to merge the two sites, and really try to gain some focus.  I still have my cooking site, which I still intend to further focus on, but hopefully by committing to using this site again for everything not cooking related, I just might be able to accomplish both.</p>
                <p>The rookie mistakes came from the fact that since Habari doesn’t have an importer in place yet to import one Habari install into another, I was faced with the only option of deleting the existing database, which was basically an import from the original WordPress installation, then dumping the bloggingmeta database, doing a quick search and replace for urls, importing that file directly into the database, then re-importing the old wordpress database using the importer plugin.  What I failed to do was check what was active in the plugins.  I already had the twitter plugin installed, so I’m guessing that it kept the settings from the old site, thus upon import, all the new posts were twittered.  Complete…rookie…mistake.  Couple with that that I also left the pingback plugin active, it tried to ping all the posts while importing.  Another party foul.  So not only did I spam Twitter, my import royally failed, so I was faced with doing the whole process over again, albeit this time I deactivated the offending plugins, and the import went off mostly without a hitch.  I might have lost a few old posts and/or comments, but all in all, I’m pleased with the outcome considering I’m doing this at 2 a.m. in the morning, and my focus might not be what it should be.  I wish I could write it off as having had a few adult beverages, but alas, I would be lying.</p>
                <p>Over the next few days I will be doing some tweaking here and there, and shutting down the other site (and doing a 301 redirect).  I really like the typography of Ali’s <a href="http://www.awhitebox.com/dark-autumn-a-new-habari-theme">theme</a>, so I most likely will try to find the custom image I had made for the bottom, and trick out a few plugins.  At least for now.</p>
