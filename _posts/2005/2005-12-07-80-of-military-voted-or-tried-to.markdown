I'd like to know a little more about the "efforts" of the DoD to connect soldiers with their citizenship.  While I commend the 79% that did their civic duty, and perhaps will make it a habit after they leave the military, I doubt the sincerity of the DoD's reasons.  You had to be living in a cave in Afganhistan, (oops, no, they knew about it too) to not know about the slim margin Bush "won" by in '00, and the discussions of the military often voting Republican, etc, etc, etc.  So Rummy made a concerted effort to "get out the vote" as soon as the war started, hoping that the patriotism and general tendacies would help him keep his job for 4 more years.  Now that his job is not on the line, and the undertone of the politcal landscape is in much darker, I wonder if the DoD will make such a push for election turnout.  And more so, I wonder if the Dems can pressure the DoD to maintain the "program", and turn the knife, so to speak, on the administration.
