    <meta name="description" content="This started out as a simple comment on Rachel’s design blog, but started getting wordy, so I converted it to a post w/trackback. (Which may be a thought for a future post, what is too long of a comment?)The part I found myself relating to was the design of Squible, and user experience, which I found myself having recently gone through. I had gotten busy, neglected my blogging, and when I got back into the swing of things,felt a new look was in order.  Not having that much time, I opted for Squible.  A good friend who also blogs noted that he “just couldn’t get his head around that format”.  I fought changing things back for some time, but that comment hung around in the back of my head.  I kept thinking that this guy is a “web guy, a designer.  If he can’t get around it, what about the other 150+ a day that stumble upon place.”  So when I changed hosts, and upgraded, I tried Squible for all of about 20 minutes, and then cobbled together a more traditional blog design.Not that as a fledgling, wanna-be designer I don’t want to push my envelope, but I have to come back to the user experience.  Much as my cooking evolved from wanting to be “everychef”, that is, I wanted to be Charlie Trotter, Jean Louis Paladin, Alan Susser, and Jean Georges Vongrichten on every plate.  Little by little, I learned that my guests weren’t looking for me to defy gravity and mix flavors that might not otherwise be mixed, simply for the sake of “pushing the envelope”.  It took me a long time to understand that my guests wanted a good meal.  Sure, an unexpected flavor that contrasts but doesn’t detract, or a creative yet accessible presentation is fine, but make it edible.  But I digress.I still want to push envelopes, and broaden horizons, and all those clichés, but first and formost, I want the ramblings, and info to be accessible, and to flow in some manner that people will “get”." />
