                <p>So when I first read about this, I thought it was much ado about nothing, a simple oversight by a transplant who registered to vote without a permanent address, blah blah, benefit of the doubt.
  Now the truth comes out that she was simply a lazy bitch who didn’t feel she needed to follow the rules.  Which is how the story originally broke.  All she had to do was fill out the change of address form, and be done with it, but no, the woman who recently used the term “raghead” in reference to Arabs in a post 9.11 world, walked out of the voting precint she should have voted in, and drove to the one she originally registered in and voted.  Which, is clearly defined in FL law, as a 3rd degree felony. What I would give to see her charged.</p>

                <p>is open to anyone, though they have a caveat that if server load gets too high, they’ll shut down registration again.  I hadn’t really paid attention to it, though I’ve seen it mentioned, but the concept is sound.  How often do you leave comments on a blog, and then forget where, and wonder if there was a follow up?  Happens to me all the time.  I keep tabs on several RSS feeds that a general in nature, and will drop a comment on a strangers blog often, only to fade from my memory.  Not anymore, if CoComments works as advertised.  You are given a simple bookmarklet to use before you formally submit a comment.  You then can keep track of the comments via their site, or better yet, your RSS feed.  In addition, you’ll see a box in my sidebar, so visitors can see where I’m visiting and commenting.  Another way of building community, in my oh, so humble opinion.  Though, I’ve yet to see it in action, I’ve seen it on another’s blog.  And I doubt it will take long before I put it in action.  So go register if interested, ‘cause it could be like Google Analytics, and close with no notice.</p>

                <p>I cobbled this design out of something else I was working on, to break out of the constraints of using someone else’s work, but intend on something extrordinary for the site, especially the oft-not  used <a href="http://www.miklb.com">entry page</a>.  So I signed up for the <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS Reboot</a> as a means of having a tangible goal, as well as some pressure to knock one out of the park.  So things won’t change much around here until May, but check back then for a whole new miklb.com.</p>

                <p>New attempts at opening up the gulf to gas and oil drilling, this under the assumption that the current methods are “safe”.  And that no accidents happened last year during the hurricanes.  Whippee.  Thankfully, even Mel Martinez is saying he will oppose the legislation, as well as most of the congressional delegation from Florida.  If they would only draft legislation taking the area off the table for X number of years, so we didn’t have to hear about this every year.  If you haven’t yet, be sure you’ve contacted your Senator and Congressman about this, or any issue you feel strongly about.</p>
