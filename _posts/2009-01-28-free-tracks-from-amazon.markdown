<a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/01/free-music-on-amazon">Kottke</a> points out that Amazon has free music for download, and checking out the list, I see that the title track from my <a href="http://miklb.com/favorite-album-of-2008-the-gaslight-anthems-the-59-sound">favorite album of 2008</a>, Gaslight Anthem's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-59-Sound/dp/B001DWXUZ6/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1233190289&sr=1-8"> <cite>'59 Sound</cite> is among the tracks available for free</a>.  Also on the list is a track from another of my top albums of the year, David Byrne and Brian Eno's  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Overtones/dp/B001GH3JMC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1233190289&sr=1-4">Strange Overtones</a>.

All in all, there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1233190277/ref=sr_pg_1?ie=UTF8&rs=334897011&rh=n%3A334897011&page=1">over 500 free tracks</a>, though at quick glance, the bulk of the list are lesser known artists.
