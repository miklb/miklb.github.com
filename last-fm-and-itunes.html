I first read a hint on how to use iTunes and Apple Scripts, however, that solution didn’t work.  Another comment on the hint pointed to Amua, which basically streams the music via iTunes.  Excellent stuff.  I now can stream my last.fm music through my stereo, using the Airport Express.  If you are a last.fm user, by all means, add me as a friend, or at least check out my musical tastes.  Though still a bit buggy, my Lifestream also tracks my most currently played selections." />
