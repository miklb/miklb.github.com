          <p>Testing out b2 of FF 3 (Mac OS X Leopard), and it seems snappier, though none of my normal extensions are available for the beta, so that might be part of it.  Certainly can’t use it for everyday browsing because of that reason.  It seems kinda odd using the native OS X theme, with Safari like buttons instead of the standard FF HTML buttons.</p>
          <p>I kinda like the Smart bookmarks feature, though the recent bookmarks isn’t really useful to me.  I’ll be curious how that might be tied into del.icio.us bookmarks (however, seeing as Yahoo! is in turmoil, I will be exploring other bookmarking services, including checking on the status of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/">scuttle</a>, a GPL script for hosting your own bookmark library ala del.icio.us).  Any suggestions for similar services welcomed.</p>
          <p>Another feature I’m not keen on just yet is when I click on the favicon, normally that would highlight the entire URL in the address bar, now it gives me some odd identity information.  Definitely a PITA.  I really use that feature for copy and pasting URLs, though there might be an easier method for that.</p>
          <p>I’ll continue to run FF 3 on the laptop, and keep 2 on my main desktop, I understand a beta3 will be out Monday, and hopefully sooner than later a RC will be around, with most of the extensions being updated around that time.  I understand extension developers not trying to keep up with alpha and beta builds for official downloads, but at some point, they should be offering some kind of indication to users whether or not the extension will be available for the new version.  Nothing worse than upgrading only to find out your favorite extension isn’t being developed for the latest release.</p>
