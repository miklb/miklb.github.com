Another reason I’ve been contemplating going back to Firefox is that Firebug is just far superior to Safari’s built in inspector.  To that end, I’ve recently come across two add-ons for Firebug." />

          <p>The first, <a href="http://robertnyman.com/firefinder/">Firefinder</a>, is a handy tool to “find HTML elements matching chosen CSS selector(s) or XPath expression”.</p>
          <p>The second is one that <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/06/introducing-page-speed.html">Google previously used internally</a>.  Today they open sourced it and released, <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/">Page Speed</a>.  Page Speed allows developers to “evaluate the performance of their web pages and to get suggestions on how to improve them.”</p>
