So I'm sitting here working, listening to CNN in the background, and the President is doing a press conference with the Prime Minister of Australia, and they open the floor to questions.  Obviously, the two pressing issues that arise are the Supreme Court and the "Leak".  First question is about the Supreme Court, and whether or not it's important to name a woman to replace O'Connor.  So, he stumbles around, as usual, and then says this doozy, " I want to be known as the kind of person who does what he says he's going to do..."<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050719.html">Link to transcript of press conference</a>.
Now, concerning the "Leak", didn't he say that if anyone that was involved worked in  the White House, they'd be fired? And hasn't he basically recanted that statement in the last few days? So, Mr. President, which is it going to be, a "person who does what he says he's going to do", or a person who does what he's told to?
