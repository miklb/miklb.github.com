                <p>In an attempt to get back to blogging, and fishing, and just about anything else healthy I can do to avoid hanging out late at night drinking Jagermeister and sitting in a smoky room, I’m going to change themes, and try to focus on the laptop and online more.  So if things go wacky or seem odd, just <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blog/contact">contact me</a> with a heads up.  Oh, and if you see anything new you like, you can always comment on that also.</p>

                <p>I rarely check my stats packages anymore like awstats and the like, I simply use the stat page I created on this site with a plugin or two.  A recent referal was a google search, “how to steal wordpress theme”.  Why would someone want to “steal” a theme?  Obviously they got to my site due to my blank wordpress theme, but there are hundreds of themes out there, and dozens of sites with info on how to customize them.  So why “steal”.  Its not like you can’t copy and paste anyone’s CSS and use it on your own, the only issues are with custom php codes on the templates.  Sad really.</p>

                <p>Good ol’ Tom has now moved to have his judge recuse himself from the case because, among other organizations, he’s donated to Moveon.org.  So what does he want, someone who’s donated to the RNC or one of his own PACs?  Or simply a judge that hasn’t donated to any political affliations?  To me, it’s just another desperate move by a rat backed into a corner.</p>

Alas, the world keeps turning, and so does the clown rodeo kown as the Tomd DeLay defense.  His lawyers are know trying to squash the money laundering because “wire transfers are not ‘funds’ “… if that’s not a backhanded admission of guilt, nothing is.  “If the glove does not fit, you must acquit”.  And to further the never give in persona of ol’ Hammer, he passed on a plea offer of a misdemeanor charge of violating Texas election laws, thus the felony charges that he currently faces.  Tom, you shoulda listened closer to the <em>Gambler</em>, “you gotta know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em…”</p>

As the <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at200524_model.html">computer models</a> have her slightly lower than the Tampa area, the most recent <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT4+shtml/190236.shtml">discussion</a> talks of some slightly different motion than previously forcast, and how the recent NOAA jet’s flight data would have on the models.  Keep an eye out folks, it ain’t over yet.</p>
