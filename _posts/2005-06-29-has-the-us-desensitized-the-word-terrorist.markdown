As I watch with one eye on global news, I continue to see heads of state refer to their "enemy" as a terrorist.  As I'm sure the argument's been made, but in the context of today's usage, the founding fathers of the United States would have been called terrorists.
For many years, the opposition was called a "rebel", or "guerrilla".  But now, every single armed dissension is a terrorist.
I mean, isn't that the core concern of those of us who oppose the Patriot Act, that there is language within it that could in essence paint any political uprising as a "terrorist organization", and thereby allow the controlling government to supersede the constitution to squelch the uprising?
<blockquote> But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security </blockquote>
  Care to guess the source?  I'll give you a hint, think <em>fireworks.</em>
