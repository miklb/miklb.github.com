After reading an aside at <a href="http://photomatt.com">Matt's blog</a> regarding Plazes using WP for its blog, I decided to check it out.  My <a href="http://beta.plazes.com/plaze/a346284130ad346f75da8ea2f4520c13/#">Plaze</a>, and it really seems like it could be kinda cool, if it catches on.  It'd be nice to know about some hot spots when traveling, or just around town.
