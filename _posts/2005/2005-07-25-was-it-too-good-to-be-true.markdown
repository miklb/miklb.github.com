So it seemed that there was no real "dirt" to stick to Roberts, that perhaps the White House nominated a "good guy", who just happened to be nominated by the right.  Even former lawyer for Clinton endorsed him.  (Not that I take that too far).  But now it's coming out, that Roberts is a card carrying member of the ultra conservative right, and worse, he doesn't "recall" getting his card.  How do you head a steering committee and not remember.  Or worse,  fake an association with a club simply for personal gain, only later to deny it.  Is that the best America has to put on the Supreme Court?
