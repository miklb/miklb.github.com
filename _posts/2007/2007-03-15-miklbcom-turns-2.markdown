<img id="image343" class="left" src="http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/dw-974859.thumbnail.jpg" alt="birthday candle" />  Perhaps a bit late, but just about 2 years ago, I started this domain, which has led me down a life path I can honestly say I didn't expect.  I no longer am cooking for a living, not going to school, and trying to make a go of it doing web design/consulting.  Thinking back on it all, I've come a long way, and look forward to where things go.  To any and all who've visited and commented, thanks.  I've recently tried to blog more in general, and also realized that the site is in need of some overhauling, as I've not really done much with the design/updating in almost a year.  So as soon as I crank out a new design for <a href="http://www.tinylittledots.com">Tiny Little Dots</a>, I'll focus some spare time on the site.
