So I've had so much fun working with WordPress and this blog, that I'm putting together another.  It's a food oriented one, something I've wanted to do since I first surfed the web.  Hopefully it will provide people with ideas for tasty, and usually easy dinners.  Interspersed will be appropriate posts on food and nutrition.  So do me a favor, bounce over to <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com"> cooking with miklb</a>  and check it out, and see if it's something you might find interesting.  It's still in the development phase, but it's never too soon to get feed back.
