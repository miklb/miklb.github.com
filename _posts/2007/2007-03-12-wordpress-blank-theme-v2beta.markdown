While I'm in a blogging flurry, I figured I'd go ahead and share my newest "blank theme".  I do quite a bit of WP work, either converting open source designs, modifying existing site's design to a WP theme, or custom work, and often have the use for a framework to start.  For the past couple of years, I've been using my popular <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/my-site/blank-wordpress-theme/">Blank Theme</a>, but more and more, I've found the markup not to my liking, and as it's based on Kubrick, a bit outdated code wise.  So I've cooked up a blank theme from scratch, using much more (hopefully) semantic markup, and a much more streamlined framework.  This version currently only has an index, header, footer, sidebar (as an unordered list, which <em>should</em> be widget ready, though I would need to add a function.php file.  It also includes a bit of code handy for recent posts), single post, and page template.  I also am using <a href="http://www.christianmontoya.com/2006/10/15/full-featured-commentsphp-template-for-wordpress/">Christian Montoya's comment template</a> instead of Kubricks.  I hopefully covered all the elements in the templates in the style sheet, as well as have a few basic global elements set.

Remember, this is a <strong>blank theme.  It is completely unstyled, and is meant as a framework in which to customize a theme</strong>.  Also, this is meant for WP >= 2.1.x, as it uses several new template tags.

<strong>Update:  Download link fixed. (damn typos)</strong>

You can download the <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blankv2beta.zip">Blank Theme v2 beta</a>.

I would appreciate any and all feed back, both for missing elements, and suggestions for additions.
