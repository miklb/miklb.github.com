While i have found myself using Facebook more and more due to keeping tabs on IRL friends, I’ve used Twitter less and less due to a busy schedule and finding it difficult to follow conversations. I’d love to find an interface that made it easy to see all of the accounts I follow and put them into lists (does that exist on twitter.com?), in the mean time, I simply want to start collecting everything back here and sharing it to social media as I see fit." />
