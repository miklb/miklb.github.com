        WordPress and Linkblox
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2005-12-02T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">02 Dec 2005</time>

    <p>So while doing a design for someone, I came across this site - <a href="http://www.blogbox.com/linkblox.php">Linkblox</a>.   Among some other flash type widgets, this one presents your links in a compact widget, especially if you have them categorized.  What’s nifty about this free widget, is that is uses OPML.  While not that familiar with it, a quick poke around the <a href="http://support.wordpress.org">forums</a>, I discovered that the links manager built into WordPress already outputs your links in an OPML file.  It’s found in your root WP folder at wp-links-opml.php.   The linkblox site simply asks for you to point to a OPML file, your URL, and then outputs a script  for you to place in your header and sidebar.  One for the header, one for the place you want your widget.  So what’s nice, is you can continue to use your “link this” bookmarklet, and keep your blogroll/links in your DB, so if the “linkblox” site disappears, or you decide to stop using it, you still have all your blogroll safely at your site.  The advanced customization for the widget gives you quite a bit of color customization, and the site promises this is a work in progress, which is why they are hosting the script, so that can make upgrades seamlessly behind the scenes.</p>

    <p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2245440&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines">ESPN.com-Congress to look into ‘deeply flawed’ BCS system</a> You have to be kidding me.  Ah, your alma matre isn’t going to the Rose Bowl this year, so it’s time to cry fowl. Boo hoo!  Try fixing the education system, or working on getting better funding for students, rather than this.  Any thing, heck, I’d rather here some discussion about giving student athletes a stipend than how the BCS is flawed.  Sure it is, so was the old bowl system.  But this is that last place Congress needs to be sticking their nose.  With record deficits, a war, corruption all over the Republican map, and this is best they’ve got.  Flabergasted, that’s all I’ve got to say. I wonder if this guy Barton is one of the ones the Texas jerrymandering case got elected?</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/29/AR2005112901288.html?nav=rss_politics">Zeroing Out the Messenger</a> So amongst all the Iraq/memo gate/plamegate/Katrina debates, another slug of a Republican Congress man, bought by Utilities companies in Oregon, managed to have a little known, yet important center shut down.  I <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/rants/judge-says-bush-salmon-plan-ignores-impact-of-dams/">wrote about this</a> last May, when a judge ruled the Bush plan on the spring and fall runs of Chinook  salmon was wrong, and forced new numbers to be used.  Well, that little known agency shut down by Congressman Larry Craig was responsible for using scientific means of measuring the population of the salmon.  Long story short, Craig convinced his fellow congressman to shut down funding for the agency, and it looks like my faith in the people of the Pacific Northwest was unfounded.</p>
