<a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=351130&start=0">SpellBound Development version</a> even works on my universal binary version of FF.  Nice to have back.
<strong><em>EDIT*</em> </strong> Seems it installed, but doesn't work as planned on the universal binary.  THe deerpark G3 optimized version of FireFox on my ibook it works flawlessly.
