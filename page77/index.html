                <p>After reading an aside at <a href="http://photomatt.com">Matt’s blog</a> regarding Plazes using WP for its blog, I decided to check it out.

It’d be nice to know about some hot spots when traveling, or just around town.</p>

                  Take heed school boards, your career may very well be short lived if you decide to force this concept on your district.  Read the score, <strong>8 out of 9</strong> encumbents lost their seat.  Even the winners were surprised by the results.  People in Tampa may very well be watching this, as the <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2005/11/08/Tampabay/Board_restores_religi.shtml">debate over holidays rages on.</a></p>

                  Bush’s response has been so far to not comment, and send his entire staff, including Rove, to ethics class.  A whole hour long on how to handle classified documents.  That’s the best he’s got?  Not quite the “heads will roll if anyone in my administration was involved” attitude his little John Wayne act tried.  I’m sure though the Republican’s will applaud such a move.

                <p>Are gmail invites still used?  I mean, I have 100 to offer, but damned if I know what to do with them.  Heck, even my two <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> invites are moot now with the whole Flock thing.  Anyway, if you need one give me a shout.</p>

                <p>With all the buzz around the net discussing Akismet, which, to me, is just another hype for wordpress.com, I came across <a href="http://error.wordpress.com/2005/10/25/bad-behavior-2-roadmap/">IOerror’s discussion</a> of his roadmap for Bad Behaivor 2.  Again, people are praising Akismet as the second coming of Christ, and if that is the case, then the combination of Spam Karma and Bad Behavior is the first coming.  Along with the roadmap, IOError discusses the reality of what it will take for him to be able to knock out the new version, CA$H.  Quite understandable, hell, this blogger had to go back to his prior profession for the exact same reason.  But the case of Bad Behavior is simple, if 100 bloggers such as this one has already done and donated a mere $10, we would in essence be hiring a full time spam fighter.  So let this be a challenge to other bloggers, jump on the bandwagon and use Kismet, or support the developer who set the standard in the first place.  I’m from the school of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”, so therefore I’m not disabling my two working anti-spam plugins to try the flavor of the week, I’d rather see the BB2 come down the pipe a month or so from now.  It’s up to you now.</p>
