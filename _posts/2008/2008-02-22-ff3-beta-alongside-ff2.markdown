Came across this handy little "app" today.  <a href="http://www.dangerouslyawesome.com/2008/02/22/more-than-one-firefox-beta-to-rule-them-all-a-dave-martorana-concoction/">MultiFirefox</a> allows for multiple profiles to use different versions of the FireFox.  So you can keep your working copy of FireFox 2 and all your beloved extensions, and test/keep an eye on FireFox 3 beta.  So far, the <em>"old-school"</em> del.icio.us extension is the one I'm really anxious to see work in 3.  

There's already a beta of <a href="http://fireclipse.xucia.com/#Downloads">Firebug</a> that works in FF3, which satisfies a few of my itches.  I'd also like to see the web developer extension, but it seems the dev of that one won't release a version until FF goes gold.  Scribefire seems to work, though I still haven't gotten in the habit of using it.  Tiny URL extension is another one that I've come to rely on, which isn't FF 3 compatible at this point.
