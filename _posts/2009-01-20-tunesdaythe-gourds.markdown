Today I bring the first installment of an idea I had, Tunesday.  Get it, Tuesday + tunes = Tunesday?  OK, not the most ingenious idea I've ever had, but since getting my iPhone, I've been listening to a lot more music since it's always with me.  And subsequently, I thought it'd be nice to feature some of my favorite bands, as a nice little break for anyone who wanders through, or follows me on Twitter.

First up in the installment is <a href="http://www.thegourds.com">The Gourds</a>.  One of my all time favorite bands, especially live, I thought it would be appropriate to feature them as they've got a new album out, <cite>Haymaker!</cite>.

The Gourds hail from Austin, TX, and for the casual listener, might characterize them as <em>country</em>, however their sound is definitely more than that, despite the types of instruments they play.  (Ironically enough, I've chosen an in store performance of a new track, <cite>Country Love</cite> to feature from YouTube).

I would simply characterize their sound as "feel good", albeit with a definite Alt-Country/Americana bend.  

I was first turned onto the Gourds about 10 years ago by my friend Sandy.  Soon there after, I found a copy of their second album, <cite>Stadium Blitzer</cite> in a thrift store of all places, but it wasn't until she started working at <a href="http://www.munichrecords.com/">Munich Records</a> and gave me a copy of <cite>Bolsa de Agua</cite> that I really saw the light.  I must have played that album straight through 5 times that first night.<cite>  Hallelujah Shine</cite> is still one of my all time favorite songs.

Since then, through the beauty of <a href="http://emusic.com">Emusic</a> and Munich Records, I've been able to collect all of their albums, and each has been a treat to listen to.  That said, their aforementioned release, <cite>Haymaker!</cite> is their best since <cite>Bolsa de Agua</cite> in my opinion.

If you'd like a invite to emusic for a trial membership and 50 free downloads (you'll have to give a CC#, but they don't charge until after the first month), leave a comment with the email address you'd like it sent to, and I"ll send one your way.  <em>  Shameless confession - you can do a trial membership without the invite from me, but if you were to sign up with emusic after the trial via invite, I'd get a 50 song credit</em>.
