    <meta name="description" content="It’s always great to see new themes released for Habari, even if they are ports.  Florian has ported the WordPress theme Clean Home to Habari.  The theme’s name aptly describes the design, a clean, black and white two column design with contrasting red headings.  The theme seems to be coded for trunk, that is, using the areas feature.  One thing I noticed is that the theme still has some cruft from WP, calling for a dynamic sidebar (widgets) with some text that also references a text widget and and admin options.  I of all people can understand though of wanting to get something out before working out all the kinks, so I’m sure he’ll update it as soon as the areas/blocks feature is fleshed out a bit more.  I also don’t speak German, so it’s quite possible he references that in the post announcing the release." />
