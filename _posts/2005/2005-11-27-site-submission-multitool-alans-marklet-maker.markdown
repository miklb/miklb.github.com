<a href="http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/alan/marklet_maker.php">Site Submission MultiTool- Alan's Marklet Maker</a> is a handy little bookmarklet maker.  I've been checking out <a href="http://www.blinklist.com">Blinklist,</a> and use delicious, and Alan's tool creates one marklet to tag the site.  Opens mutlple windows.  Very handy.  Numerous other online services available as well.
