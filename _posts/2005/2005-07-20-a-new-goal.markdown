So CNN has this feature in their afternoon politics show, where these two chicks are surfin' the web for blogs and what's being discussed about the current events.  So I realize all they are really doing is searching Technorati for keywords. And though I know Technorati pulls categories as tags, a politics rant may not show up in a search about Tom DeLay.  Thus, I installed a tag generator for the site (via a <a href="http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-keywords">WordPress plugin, Jerome's keywords</a>) so that I can start adding tags to my posts, and possibly get some hotty on CNN to read my post on air.  Is that not the most geeky thing to strive for?
