I'm confused. I set an <code><pre>< h2 ></pre></code> tag with an #id, and give it a background image.  I want both the image and the text to be a clickable link.  Thus, I want to wrap the <code><pre>< h2 ></pre></code> tag <strong>inside</strong> the anchor tag.  Validator tells me it's not valid HTML.  I set the anchor to a class of .block, which is defined as <pre>.block {display:block}</pre>.  Still doesn't validate.  Do you see the logic? Or, am I just making a mistake?
