I recently <a href="http://miklb.com/updated-themes">updated my themes</a>, and since that time a change has been made in trunk in how pagination is handled.  All 3 three themes have been updated for this change.  I will be leaving download links for the previous versions up as well, as I <em>believe</em> those versions should work with 0.4.1.  If you experience any problems with either version, please set me know.

Downloads and more info on each theme available on their original post.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://miklb.com/swanky-theme">swanky</a></li>
<li><a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi">mzingi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://miklb.com/harvest-field-a-new-habari-theme">Harvest Field</a></li>
</ul>

Also, I have a <a href="http://themes.miklb.com">demo site</a> up and running to check them out.  I still need to tweak the themeswitcher plugin so you can only select certain themes from your theme directories, so note that only <strong>my 3 themes</strong> have the switcher code.
