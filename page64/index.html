            <p>This started out as a simple comment on <a href="http://www.cre8d-design.com/blog/2006/02/22/blog-layouts-boring/">Rachel’s design blog</a>, but started getting wordy, so I converted it to a post w/trackback. (Which may be a thought for a future post, what is too long of a comment?)
The part I found myself relating to was the design of Squible, and user experience, which I found myself having recently gone through.
 I had gotten busy, neglected my blogging, and when I got back into the swing of things,felt a new look was in order.  Not having that much time, I opted for Squible.  A good friend who also blogs noted that he “just couldn’t get his head around that format”.  I fought changing things back for some time, but that comment hung around in the back of my head.  I kept thinking that this guy is a “web guy, a designer.  If he can’t get around it, what about the other 150+ a day that stumble upon place.”  So when I changed hosts, and upgraded, I tried Squible for all of about 20 minutes, and then cobbled together a more traditional blog design.<br />
              Not that as a fledgling, wanna-be designer I don’t want to push my envelope, but I have to come back to the user experience.  Much as my cooking evolved from wanting to be “everychef”, that is, I wanted to be <a href="http://www.charlietrotters.com/index.asp">Charlie Trotter</a>, Jean Louis Paladin, <a href="www.chefallen.com/home.cfm">Alan Susser</a>, and <a href="http://www.jean-georges.com/main.html">Jean Georges Vongrichten</a> on every plate.  Little by little, I learned that my guests weren’t looking for me to defy gravity and mix flavors that might not otherwise be mixed, simply for the sake of “pushing the envelope”.  It took me a long time to understand that my guests wanted a <em>good</em> meal.  Sure, an unexpected flavor that contrasts but doesn’t detract, or a creative yet accessible presentation is fine, but make it edible.  But I digress.
I still want to push envelopes, and broaden horizons, and all those clichés, but first and formost, I want the ramblings, and info to be accessible, and to flow in some manner that people will “get”.</p>

            <p>So when I first read about this, I thought it was much ado about nothing, a simple oversight by a transplant who registered to vote without a permanent address, blah blah, benefit of the doubt.
  Now the truth comes out that she was simply a lazy bitch who didn’t feel she needed to follow the rules.  Which is how the story originally broke.  All she had to do was fill out the change of address form, and be done with it, but no, the woman who recently used the term “raghead” in reference to Arabs in a post 9.11 world, walked out of the voting precint she should have voted in, and drove to the one she originally registered in and voted.  Which, is clearly defined in FL law, as a 3rd degree felony. What I would give to see her charged.</p>

            <p>is open to anyone, though they have a caveat that if server load gets too high, they’ll shut down registration again.  I hadn’t really paid attention to it, though I’ve seen it mentioned, but the concept is sound.  How often do you leave comments on a blog, and then forget where, and wonder if there was a follow up?  Happens to me all the time.  I keep tabs on several RSS feeds that a general in nature, and will drop a comment on a strangers blog often, only to fade from my memory.  Not anymore, if CoComments works as advertised.  You are given a simple bookmarklet to use before you formally submit a comment.  You then can keep track of the comments via their site, or better yet, your RSS feed.  In addition, you’ll see a box in my sidebar, so visitors can see where I’m visiting and commenting.  Another way of building community, in my oh, so humble opinion.  Though, I’ve yet to see it in action, I’ve seen it on another’s blog.  And I doubt it will take long before I put it in action.  So go register if interested, ‘cause it could be like Google Analytics, and close with no notice.</p>

            <p>I cobbled this design out of something else I was working on, to break out of the constraints of using someone else’s work, but intend on something extrordinary for the site, especially the oft-not  used <a href="http://www.miklb.com">entry page</a>.  So I signed up for the <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS Reboot</a> as a means of having a tangible goal, as well as some pressure to knock one out of the park.  So things won’t change much around here until May, but check back then for a whole new miklb.com.</p>
