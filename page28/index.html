        Why Even Call it Second Day Air AT&T?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2008-12-30T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">30 Dec 2008</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mrfrosted/240308153/"><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/ups_scooter.jpg" alt="ups scooter" class="left" /></a>So with AT&amp;T offering $99 refurbished iPhones until the thirty-first, I swallowed my bitterness towards cell phone contracts and ordered a phone Saturday morning.  Like 8am on Saturday.  They offered free 2nd Day Air, but stupid me didn’t check the method, I just assumed it would be regular US mail.  I received an email Sunday saying the item had been shipped, which led me to believe even more so that it had shipped Saturday via US mail.  However, yesterday morning, I took a closer look at the email, and saw tracking info.  It was being shipped UPS, and the tracking info showed no movement.  Today I checked it, and it left Dallas at 8:15pm.  So much for 2nd day air.</p>

<p>Aside from now being anxious to start <s>playing with</s> using my iPhone, (I’ll be in a location that doesn’t have any internet to speak of through the weekend), I’ll be leaving for said trip first thing tomorrow morning, so I didn’t want the phone sitting on my porch until Sunday evening.  I called UPS thinking that I could simply have them keep the package at the Tampa shipping center, and pick it up before I left.  Even if I didn’t have time to activate it, it wouldn’t be sitting there beckoning some noisy teenager to steal it.</p>

<p>UPS’s automated 1-800 number leaves something to be desired to say the least.  They must have held a competition for the most annoying voice, because this woman’s voice is disturbing to say the least.  I tried the usual “operator” and “help” at the prompts, but each time was met with the recording asking me if I wanted to “trackapackage”.  Yes, a new word in the English lexicon, “trackapackage”.</p>

<p>I finally found a human via a local UPS Store, who told me the magic word is “representative”, and to just keep repeating it, ignoring anything the automated prompts tried to use to derail me from talking to a human.  This worked, and after a few minutes on hold, I was speaking to a real live person.  This woman, Danielle I believe she told me her name was, said that UPS doesn’t “intercept” packages before their first attempted delivery.  I grumbled a “thanks AT&amp;T and UPS”, and she said to give her the tracking number, and <strong>IF</strong> the package were to arrive in Tampa before 6pm, someone <em>might</em> be able to pull it and I could pick it up this evening.  However when she saw the timestamp on the origin scan from Dallas, she didn’t sound hopeful that scenario would unfold.</p>

<p>So now I must find a neighbor who can check on the package and hold it for me, which really isn’t a big deal, but had I known that 2nd day Air didn’t really mean 2nd Day air, I would have paid the extra charge to have it overnighted, and avoided the headache altogether.</p>

<p>Fortunately my Nokia has a pretty good 3G connection, and a decent browser, not to mention Google mail/maps, so I won’t be totally disconnected, not that I couldn’t probably stand going dark for a few days, but I’ve got too much work pending to completely go off the grid.  Plus, I’m really looking forward to snapping some shots of the last sunset of ‘08 and first sunrise of ‘09 for a New Years day post.  The pass on the north end of the island I’ll be on has a great vantage point for taking both, and now that I’m a little more familiar with the little point and shoot camera I’ve got, not to mention sporting a tripod now, I’m really hoping to get some good photos.</p>

<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

        Cleaning My Online House
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2008-12-30T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">30 Dec 2008</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/signal_focus.jpg" alt="signal focus" class="right" />I’ve started a draft of a post on getting older, New Year’s resolutions, and where I want to be in ‘09, but an aside to that is I’ve come to the realization that I need to limit the “noise” of my online world, which is the predominate one I live in.  Specifically, the last couple of days that means cleaning out syndication feeds, and not just pruning dead ones.  It means seriously evaluating everything that comes through my reader and determining if it’s a source of information or entertainment that is of value to me; determining if the volume of content justifies a constant bombardment from the source.  Because several items in my reader are of time sensitive nature, I generally have my reader always open, fetching content every 15 minutes.  Only when I’m in a serious crunch mode do I shut the reader down.  I’m sure I could create filters of some nature that only fetched the time sensitive ones at a more regular interval, and the less time sensitive set to a manual updating, however I’ve come to enjoy the steady flow of information throughout the day.  It’s just that I need to hone that stream.</p>

<p>One thing that’s also become abundantly clear over the last few weeks is that several of the sources in my feed reader are being duplicated due to my use of Twitter (either automated heralds of new blog posts, or manual linking).   Seeing that Twitter contains entertaining and informative tidbits that don’t make it onto most blogs, the obvious choice was to dump the source in my reader, and continue to follow via Twitter.</p>

<p>Ironically enough, the genesis of this revelation was the result of having <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">signal vs. noise</a>,  and the <a href="http://productblog.37signals.com/">37 signals product blog</a> in my reader, and following <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried">@jasonfried</a> on Twitter.  There is so much redundancy and overlapping between the 3, that more often than not, all 3 would hit my “inbox” within minutes of each other with the same content.  I certainly understand why, as most people aren’t following all 3, so Jason and 37 signals are trying to market and share information to the widest audience.  Unfortunately for those like me, it becomes a nuisances, albeit an enlightening one that spurred a much needed tuning of the throughput.</p>

<p>Now that I’m in this mode, it also means that I’m shrewdly evaluating all blog feeds.  A perfect example was tonight, Dave Winer’s <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>.  5 photos, in separate posts, with no context.  Rather I should say, no context <em>to me</em>.  Though I generally find his posts about blogging and “social media” thought provoking, whether I agree with his point or not, the majority of his content isn’t germane to my goals and focus.  So out it went.  That’s not to say when I have some downtime, and want to read a movie review from an amateur film buff ( and I use amateur only in the sense that reviewing films doesn’t put food on his table, as far as I know), that I won’t wander over to the actual site and peruse his site.</p>

<p>Certainly this process is also being applied to whom I follow on Twitter, as evident by this <a href="http://twitter.com/miklb/status/1070037601">declaration:</a>&lt;blockquote&gt;when someone incessantly twitters about twitter, I call the line and unfollow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  This also applies to a few of the more recent people I’ve followed who find it necessary to welcome each of their new followers with a new tweet.  Is there any harm in using all 140 characters and possibly welcoming more than one at a time?  And is it really necessary to welcome them?  Why not just provide good and interesting content in your tweets instead?  Even better, if they reply to something you talk about, bloody respond to them.  That’s the purpose.  It’s not all about you…anyway, I digress.</p>

<p>Finally, I feel as though I should clarify that I’ve resurrected this weblog as a means to commit thoughts down to “paper”, and affirm to myself why I’ve chosen this path, the one of an online world.  If for some reason it provokes someone else, all the better.  If it provokes a discussion, then I’ve succeeded.  If at worst, I can look back and provoke myself to get back on track, it’s not all that bad a thing.</p>

        <p>First, I’ve oft meant to write something about Twitter, specifically since I read <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2008/01/03/self-publishing-is-the-new-blogging/">Zeldman’s “Self Publishing is the New Blogging”</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
And ch-ching was heard in the land. And the (not citizen) journalists heard it, and it got them pecking into their Blackberries and laptops.

And then the writers and designers, ashamed at rubbing shoulders with common humanity, discovered the 140-character Tweet and the Tumblr post. No stink of commerce, no business model, nothing that could even charitably be called content, and best of all, no effort. Peck, peck, send. 
</blockquote>
<p>I discovered “blogging” and the culture surrounding it just before what I assume is the time when “…(not citizen) journalists heard it…”.  It was an exciting discovery, which ultimately lead me to the career I (usually) enjoy now.  And as much I probably contribute to the <em>not citizen</em> “pecking at their Blackberries and laptops”, and as much as Twitter has long lost the purity of “not having a stink of commerce”, I personally enjoy the freedom of 140 character rants, without any concern whether anyone is reading them or not.  I use Twitter solely because there’s a certain cathartic release in firing off something like “trying to explain browser differences on form styling is like swimming in 3 day old mashed potatoes”.</p>

<p>Anyway, that wasn’t the original intent of this post.  Rather, there really is another reason I enjoy Twitter.  It’s a compelling way to get a glimpse into the lives of people that you’ve crossed paths with and whom you find interesting or share common interests with, but haven’t had the opportunity to really get to know.</p>

<p>Then something like today happens.  I’d been away from technology the last twenty four hours, and wanted a light hearted way of catching up with what was going on in the world, and the web in particular.  Plus, there’s always a few good laughs along the way (see <a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">@hotdogsladies</a>).</p>

<p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/cscott_twitter.jpg" alt="twitter" class="left" />Then this tweet came across Twitterific.  First, I’ve not really ever met either Chris or Sean.  <a href="http://iamzed.com/">Chris</a> I began following after he began following me at blogOrlando3.  I wasn’t even sure who he was until the brief encounter we had at the after party.  (Chris was the lucky guy handing out the drink tickets.  Everyone’s best friend for at least 5 minutes.)  Afterward I realized that he helped <a href="http://hyku.com/blog/">Josh Hallet</a> with the the conference.  I, like many people, truly enjoyed blogOrlando, the vibe surrounding it, and felt anyone who put that together or were involved I’d like to eventually get to know.  So I follow several people that were at blogOrlando, including Chris, Josh, and <a href="http://twitter.com/jharr">Jeremy</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://seancoates.com/">Sean</a> I first encountered in the Habari IRC channel when he came along looking for help with getting some patches committed so he could fix the s9y importer and migrate his blog to Habari.  Always excited for a new user/community member, I committed his patches, and soon noticed him hanging around the channel.  Long story short, Sean is now part of the PMC of Habari, and can commit his own damn patches  now ;-).</p>

<p>My point?  I guess after writing this I don’t have something profound to say.  I’d just never seen a correspondence between Chris or Sean on Twitter in the time I’ve been following both.  Certainly I don’t know either well enough to know if they actually have met, which wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility for two developers (who also share a love of great beer, another reason I enjoy their tweets) to have met.</p>

<p>But it gave me one of those smiles and six degrees of separation moments.</p>

<p>Oh, did I mention it gave me a smile after a couple of shit weeks?</p>

        Favorite Album of 2008: The Gaslight Anthem's The '59 Sound

    <time datetime="2008-12-20T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">20 Dec 2008</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/59sound_web.jpg" alt="The '59 Sound" class="right" />First, let me reiterate, it’s <em>my</em> favorite album of 2008, not a declaration that’s the <strong>best</strong> album of the year.  From the opening crackles of the old skool sound of a needle on vinyl on <cite>Great Expectations</cite> to the melancholy anthem-esque <cite>The Backseat</cite>, <cite>The ‘59 Sound</cite> is just a great listen all the way through.</p>

<p>The album is ripe with all the things I turn to in the music I listen to regularly—whiskey and cigarette tinged vocals, driving bass lines, and jangly guitar riffs.  The subject of the lyrics tend to revolve around mortality, regret, and lost loves, without ever sounding like there’s no chance for redemption.</p>
<blockquote>
But every slow mans song
Is a night I'd like to spend with you
Just twisting the night away

<p>From <cite>Cassanova, Baby!</cite></p>

<p>Critics of the Jersey based band have sighted the obvious Springsteen influences (think <cite>Nebraska</cite> era Springsteen, not <cite>Born in the U.S.A</cite>), which to me isn’t a bad thing.  However, they also have a punk tinged sensibility ala another band that’s still in heavy rotation in my music players, Lucero.  I lament having missed The Gaslight Anthem this fall when they passed through town, however, they are playing the <a href="http://www.langerado.com/2009/langerad09.php?sec=14">Langerado Festival</a> this year, which has a line up that reads like my 5 star ratings in iTunes.  Ryan Adams, Lucero, The Gaslight Anthem, The Pogues, Bad Brains, the list goes on.  I certainly hope to catch them in  a club on their way to or from the festival, as that’s really the environment I think they’d be best.  Packed, sweaty, and bourbon fueled.</p>

<p>Several other albums were on my list of faves for ‘08.  Second place most certainly would go to The Hold Steady’s <cite>Stay Positive</cite> if for nothing other than the last track, <cite>Slapped Actress</cite>.  However, the whole album simply rocks.  Also on the short list would be the Brian Eno/David Byrne collaboration <cite>Listen Everything That Happens Will Happen Today</cite>.</p>

<p>Other highlights for 2008 were Cat Power’s <cite>Jukebox</cite>, Drive by Trucker’s <cite>Brighter Than Creation’s Dark</cite>,  Okkervil River’s <cite>Stand In</cite>, Vampire Weekend’s <cite>Vampire Weekend</cite>, and Deerhunter’s <cite>Microcastle</cite>, though that last one was only recently released, and I’ve not listened to it a lot yet, but my initial thoughts are it’s a nice change of pace from my regular listening styles.</p>

<p>Any indie albums at the top of your list for 2008 I should check out?  I’m always looking to discover new music (especially indie bands I can get from emusic).</p>

        Calendar Syncing: Lightning, Google, iCal and Nokia e62
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2008-12-07T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">07 Dec 2008</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/sync.jpg" alt="sync" class="right" />I’m still railing against signing a contract with a cell carrier, so I haven’t purchased a new phone in some time, but the bigger need to have a more robust cell phone these days had me revive my Nokia e62.  All in all, it’s a pretty good phone, with a decent built in browser (based on Webkit if I recall) and works well with my existing pay as I go plan.  I even managed to coax an unlimited data plan out of AT&amp;T.  The e62 also plays pretty well with my Macs—bluetooth syncing of contacts and calendar, the Nokia Media manager will sync an iTunes folder directly to the phone, so a 2GB card gives me a decent amount of music for on the go.</p>

<p>Anyway, I recently began using Thunderbird 3.0, aka Shredder, which is still pre beta.  That meant to really use it, I had to use the nightly build of Lightning, 1.0pre.  As with any Mozilla alpha product, you can expect most extensions to not work, which certainly is the case with these two.  I really like the combination, despite the occasional glitches, and wanted to find a way to sync Lightning with the phone.  What an adventure that turned out to be.</p>

<p>Everything I found searching the web suggested using an extension for syncing the Google Calendar with Lightning, which obviously wasn’t compatible with these versions, and even testing it with the stable releases, I couldn’t get it to work, so off I searched for another way.  Enter <a href="http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/">GCALDaemon</a>, something I’d seen written about on several ocassions but had never quite investigated.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/usage12.html">Mac OS X installation</a> guidelines (installing in Applications vs usr/local/sbin), and being sure to use the the shell script config-editor definitely is the simplest way.  I’m certainly not a black belt in unix-fu, but following the instructions for <a href="http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/usage.html#top">syncing with Sunbird/Lightning</a> and the config-editor even I was able to get Lighting 1.0pre synced with a Google Apps calendar fairly effortlessly.</p>

<p>The next step was to sync iCal (or so I thought) with the Google Calendar so I could then sync it with my phone.  I briefly toyed with GCALDaemon for that too, however my impatience led me to give Google’s <a href="http://code.google.com/p/calaboration/">Calaboration</a> tool a spin. Fortunately it was quick and painless, and I was soon syncing the same Google Apps calendar with iCal that was synced with Lightning.</p>

<p>However (<em>there’s always a but, isn’t there</em>), I soon found out that you can’t sync from the phone’s calendar to a network calendar.  So anything I were to add to the phone, would need to be transferred to the network calendar.  I’m pretty lazy as it is, so adding a step like that seemed like a recipe for losing an important date.  For iPhone users, this also seems to be the case.  So now what?</p>

<p>Another search turned up <a href="http://thenokiablog.com/2008/09/29/how-to-sync-google-calendar-apple-ical-and-nokia-phone-calendar/">this post on syncing a Nokia calendar with iCal and Google</a>, and suggested <a href="http://www.goosync.com/">Goosnyc</a>. I wasn’t keen on using a 3rd party service, but I figured I’d test it out at least, and see where it goes.  Their SMS to automate the sync settings never arrived, so I followed the <a href="http://www.goosync-forum.com/showthread.php?t=8">Nokia e61/e62 manual syncing</a> instructions, which were spot on (once I figured out that I needed to look in “Office” for the Sync settings), and within a few minutes, my Nokia e62 was synced to my Google Apps calendar which was synced to LIghtning and iCal.</p>

<p>I still need to sort out a few minor issues with the phone now syncing with iCal, as I had some holiday calendars and what not synced to the phone, which then added the dates to the Google Calendar, so in iCal I was getting the same holidays showing up multiple times.  That’s easily remedied by not displaying those calendars, but conveniently gives me all of the holidays on the other calendars.  I also need to make sure that when I sync the phone to iCal, I don’t get duplicate entries in the local calendar, but again, I think I can get around that by simply creating a “phone” calendar, and hiding it in iCal.</p>

<p>Goosync does require a manual sync to Google Calendar, but that’s less of a hassle than migrating entries from one calendar to the other.  All in all, I’m quite pleased now that I can add items directly from an email into my calendar, or right into my phone, and it will conveniently appear in all of my calendars.</p>

<p>If anyone knows of a more seemless method, I’m all ears.</p>
