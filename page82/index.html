                <p>So I can post with this contraption, but I don’t see all the options.  I see a thing for categories, but I can’t see how to add them.  This wouldn’t be very handy if I’m stuck with the generic default category.    I do like the idea however, of having a single interface that I post from.  So my WP Station blog, cookingwith, etc. all come from here.</p>
                <p><strong>EDIT</strong> OK, so I quit, and reloaded MarsEdit, and was able to “refresh” my site, and categories loaded.  Good.  I’ll add my cooking site later, to see how that handles a multitude of categories.  I’m also curious about tags, but that’s for another post.  I’m starting to like this “blogging client” situation.</p>

                <p>Well, in a round about way.  John Stewart and his show <em>The Daily Show</em> won an Emmy Last night for some kind of comedy show.  I didn’t watch the awards, rarely have.  I was busy with my own comedy of errors, but that’s another story.  But in some fashion, if he didn’t do it last night, Stewart has to share that award with the Bush administration.  Know that Stewart is an equal opportunity critic, and his jokes are only pointed towards those who blow it, not one party or another.<br />
                  But my real question is this - Does this award create an even greater undercurrent of anti-administration disdain, or does painting <em>The Daily Show</em> as pure comedy, and not satire, minimize the sad truth that is at the core of most of Stewart’s show?</p>

                <p>So I’ve been looking at some Mac OS X apps, for various tasks.  I’ve started using RSS more and more, and I’m not too keen on the Sage extension for FireFox.  Mainly because of screen real estate on the ol’ ibook.  NetNewsWire seems to be the choice, and through that, I’m playing with Mars Edit, a blogging app.  So this is my fist attempt at blogging outside the web interface.  If it works out, it may be an easier way to post, if nothing more than the built in spell check.  We’ll see about the other features.  Downside is it’s not a free app, so it better well prove to invaluable, or when its trial runs out, to the curb with it.</p>

                <p>Much has been written and discussed regarding the preparedness, or lack there of, in Louisiana, and surrounding areas, especially regarding the levees.  So much to my surprise, I get an email today from <a href="http://www.factcheck.org"> Factcheck.org </a>, and it leads off with a link to the Louisiana Department of Homeland Security.  The <a href="http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/newsrelated/incaseofemrgencyexercise.htm">link </a> is a repost of a Times Picayune article outlining a dry run done July of 2004, before Charley and Ivan, of the effects of a <strong>Cat 3</strong> storm on the levees and underlying parishes.  Just another example of ineptness, and deceptions the administration continue to hide from.</p>
