      <p>I’ve thoroughly enjoyed resurrecting this blog over the past 2 months, all the while trying to find the motivation to start food blogging again.  However, the more I search for that motivation, the more I’m drawn to the idea of further consolidating my blogging efforts to this single domain.  It’s not as if I get a huge amount of traffic on my cooking content anyway, and what little there is, should easily migrate over much like bloggingmeta’s traffic did with a permanent redirect.</p>

<p>One idea I had was to see if I’d do more food blogging by simply posting them to this site first, without migrating the old content, but if I were to succeed in my experiment, I’d find myself in a similar predicament in that I’d have no way to migrate back to the food blog, not to mention I’d potentially be penalizing myself in regards to search engine <em>stuff</em>.</p>

<p>The primary obstacle is how to migrate the content.  I highly doubt my code-fu would allow me to write a Habari-to-Habari importer by myself, though I’ve not even looked at any of the importers.  I’m not as worried about comments, so I’ve got some too-ashamed-to-disclose hacks I’m contemplating to overcome the importing dilemma.  If anyone wants to help with this goal, I’ll contribute as much as I can to making a formal Habari migration plugin.</p>

<p>Once I were to overcome that obstacle, the goal then would be to design a magazine-ish style theme that would allow for sections based on tags.  As I find myself blogging more and more about the iPhone, I’ve been <a href="http://twitter.com/miklb/status/1157627875">concerned</a> that it might turn off the few readers I have.  Building on the tag based sections would also allow me to better offer tag based feeds—though I don’t know if it’s possible to create a feed by excluding a tag ;-).  I’m sure I could easily redirect the feed from the cooking site to a /atom/tag/food (or what ever the structure is).</p>

<p>So I’m hoping that one of the 25 odd subscriber/readers might have an opinion on such a move in both how it might effect me search engine wise, and what your opinion would be on having such a diverse amount of content.</p>
