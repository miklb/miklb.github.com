                <p>Earlier today over on <a href="last post on Apple Pay">Pencil Note</a> there was a post about Apple Pay and the author spoke to their opinion on how the CurrentC plan from retailers like CVS and Walmart would actually <em>benefit</em> consumers. Upon reading the post in my RSS reader, I quickly <a href="https://twitter.com/miklb/status/527099202103697408">tweeted a question</a> asking if he really though the retailers would pass the savings onto customers. Their response was &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Less credit cards means lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
—<cite> <a href="https://twitter.com/pencil_line/status/527176352794165248">Pencil Note</a> </cite></p>
                <p>And then, in an old fashioned blogging style, they posted a more-than-140-character reply - <a href="http://www.pencilnote.com/pencilnote/2014/10/28/r2c95cwsnaoikrzdizm3ecyr6xynfd">Why fewer credit cards mean lower prices</a>. While my formal education on economics is limited to 101 level micro &amp; macro economics courses, I’ve been an informed consumer for long enough to follow the train of thought in that post. While it makes sense that the retailers are fueled by growth, and there is already a race to the bottom for pricing, the end result is still more profit for the owners/shareholders. If the price drops a few cents here or there, it is my opinion that is purely a by-product of profit growth and not the intention.</p>

                  Classic American Chefs Honored  on US Postage Stamps

                <p>Stumbling around the web this evening, came across this limited edition set of <a href="https://store.usps.com/store/browse/uspsProductDetailMultiSkuDropDown.jsp?categoryNav=false&amp;navAction=push&amp;navCount=0&amp;productId=S_472304&amp;categoryId=buy-stamps">5 American chefs celebrated on US Postage stamps</a>. The one chef that stood out to me was Edna Lewis. I suppose there <em>isn’t</em> another American who personified Southern, low-country cooking more than Ms Lewis, but was still surprised to see her along side Julia Child, James Beard and others. Not surprised as though she doesn’t belong, just that she’s not as much a household name.</p>
                <p>When I first started cooking, I stumbled onto her book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B0LP5I0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B0LP5I0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=miklb-20&amp;linkId=FLKS4ZL23UX56HNY">In Pursuit of Flavor</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=miklb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00B0LP5I0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />(note, it doesn’t appear to be still in print, but a Kindle version is available). Its less a book of recipes—though they are in the book—rather more a look into <em>how</em> she cooked. It would be an understatement to say her words in that book shaped the way I approach food even to this day.</p>
                <p>I think the names Childs and Beard speak for themselves. I’m not familiar with Felipe Rojas-Lombardi, and am only slightly familiar with Joyce Chen, but if they were deemed to be contemporaries of of Lewis and Child for their cuisines, I will look to learn about their contributions to the American plate.</p>

                <p>I used to do these posts, and well, I got lost in social media and life…this evening though listening to music on my back porch (Airplay is awesome!) I went down a rabbit hole of my music library and found myself listening to Jason Molina.</p>
                <p>I’m not sure when/how I discovered him; might have been after seeing My Morning Jacket at the New World Brewery in Tampa and finding his band Songs: Ohio did a split EP with MMJ. However it went, I was a fan. Pretty sure I saw him with Songs: Ohio, but I know I saw him solo. At least twice.</p>
                <p>I was sad to read that he lost a battle. Think I read there’s a tribute album out there, but too lazy to link to it. Suffice to say, if you didn’t experience him when he walked this Earth, you might want to put him in your queue.</p>

                <p>I have no idea if this was a “sanctioned” video or not, but it’s quite well done. I almost want to make my own with the epic Florida summer storm clouds I see daily while driving in west central Florida.</p>

                <p>My work life has prevented me from doing anything much related to online life, or writing much in general. That however doesn’t mean that during the hundreds of miles a day I’ve been driving that I don’t think about it. While catching up on my RSS feeds, this post from the Pastry Box, <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/federico-brigante/2014-july-25">You don’t have time for perfection</a> sums up a lot of why I didn’t use it more when I actually did web development.</p>
                <blockquote>I’ve had enough of maybe-later, of I’m too busy right now, of after I’m done with this. I’ll be publishing anything I think others will benefit from. Ten non-perfect pieces are better than zero wannabe-perfect ones.</blockquote>
                <p>Perhaps from where  I’m sitting, it won’t always be what I think others might benefit from, rather a benefit to me. Be it saving a snippet of code for posterity (which <em>could</em> benefit others), reflecting on a moment or just sharing thoughts about a band. Anything to have it centralized and outside the walls of Facebook, Twitter and the like.</p>
