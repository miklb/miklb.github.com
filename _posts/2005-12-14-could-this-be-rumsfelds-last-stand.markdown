<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/14/AR2005121400774.html">House Panel Subpoenas Rumsfeld on Katrina</a>  Rumors have flown for weeks, months, hell, years, that Rumsfeld was on his way out.  News reports have surfaced that the Bush administration, in attempts to woo moderate Dems, was going to name the military genius and failed VP candidate Lieberman, to replace Rummy.  But Rumsfeld stands by his declaration that he wasn't going to retire any time soon.  But could the White House take this opportunity of a Republican led inquiry into the Katrina response to throw Rumsfeld under the bus and use his departments handling of the things, and not the hot potato of Iraq as the "last straw" to force out Rumsfeld, and temporarily deflect attention, and at the same time, protect, the so far, under the radar Andy Card?
