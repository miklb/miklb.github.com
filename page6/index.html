          <div class="e-content">
            <p>My quest began when I began using Drafts app (among many other ways) to keep a fishing log. I created a TextExpander fill-in snippet to quickly enter what (if anything) was caught, the date, the type of lure(s) used, etc. I really wanted to automate adding the weather conditions as well, but alas, my search for that solution turned up nothing…until yesterday.</p>
            <p>It started when <a href="https://twitter.com/drdrang">@drdrang</a> shared a <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a> script to <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/01/location-and-leverage/">leverage the location inside iOS</a>. Later he shared <a href="https://gist.github.com/hiilppp/8268816">another version</a>, from <a href="https://twitter.com/hiilppp">@hiilppp</a>.</p>
            <p>Armed with that knowledge and a rudimentary knowledge of the <a href="https://developer.forecast.io">forecast.io API</a>, I set off to <strike>steal</strike> crib some Python usage of their API. Enter  <a href="https://twitter.com/jayhickey">@jayhickey</a> and his <a href="https://github.com/jayhickey/Pythonista-Scripts/blob/master/PySky.py">PySky</a> script. While written for the v1 Dark Skies API, it gave me enough Python to convert to the new v2 of Forecast.io.</p>
            <p>The result?</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/miklb/8346411.js"></script>
            <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/miklb/8346411">original gist</a></p>
            <p>This version simply grabs the current weather summary and temperature from your current location, meant to be used with <a href="https://twitter.com/draftsapp">@draftsapp</a> as a URL action <code class="highlighter-rouge">pythonista://py_forecast?action=run&amp;argv=[[draft]]</code>. Dr. Drang suggests using <a href="https://gist.github.com/omz/4076735">New From Gist</a>, however I had better success using <a href="http://ioctocat.com">iOctocat</a>. There is an “open in…” dialog when viewing your gists or starred gists, and pick Pythonista.</p>
            <p>Certainly for my fishing log I am expanding on this to include wind, sunrise and set times as well as the recently added moon phase. I figured a more generic version would be best shared, but please do not hesitate to leave a comment or  ask me a question on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/miklb">@miklb</a>. I’ll do my best to help, as I’m indebted to the aforementioned gents for sharing their code and helping in the first place.</p>

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>I stumbled upon this quote from Thomas Keller a few days ago, and it’s been haunting me ever since.</p>
            <blockquote>It’s not about passion. Passion is something that we tend to overemphasize, that we certainly place too much importance on. Passion ebbs and flows. To me, it’s about desire. If you have constant, unwavering desire to be a cook, then you’ll be a great cook. If it’s only about passion, sometimes you’ll be good and sometimes you won’t. You’ve got to come in every day with a strong desire. With passion, if you see the first asparagus of the springtime and you become passionate about it, so much the better, but three weeks later, when you’ve seen that asparagus every day now, passions have subsided. What’s going to make you treat the asparagus the same? It’s the desire.</blockquote>

            <p>While I certainly can relate to the culinary element of this – I think I had the desire – it strikes a nerve more so in my <em>career</em> as a web developer. I think I had the passion, just not the desire. Three weeks after the first time I used some new tool or trick, it lost its luster. I didn’t get excited, I wasn’t the type of person to want to get up early and do it all over again. So I spent the last year or so of being a developer chasing the newest shiny thing so I didn’t have to deal with the everyday.</p>
            <p>Even after reading this, I’m not sure it would have struck a nerve if I didn’t think I’d found a new profession that I do have the desire for. Long after the bloom is off the rose, I’m still excited to do the routine.</p>

            <p>I target redfish routinely in Tampa Bay, and while I often fall back to the classic blackened redfish, this sounds like a nice change of pace. I might tweak it by using a little wine, probably a riesling, but otherwise, sounds like a perfect spring dish.</p>
