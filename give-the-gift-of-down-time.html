For the past 2+ months, its been one problem after another, with the most recent being an 12 plus hour down time because of a failed maintenance.  They talk of credits for users, however I’m not seeing one in my account.  A company I work with received the email, however, not my personal account.  So on the heals of this debacle, they are offering gift  cards for a years worth of hosting.  As if someone would want to give you a migraine for Christmas." />
