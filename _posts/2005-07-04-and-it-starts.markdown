So begins our real hurricane season here in Florida.  With a sizable tropical depression in the SE Caribbean expected to turn into a hurricane by Thursday, and to be off the SW coast of Florida by Saturday, the hurricane watch is on.  As Charlie  (??) last year was on a similar path, with a quick right hand turn at any point, everyone from Naples to Cedar Key will be collectively holding their breath.  And at this point, all computer models have very similar paths, so it seems definite we will see lots of rain, and possibly worse.  
Time will tell.
