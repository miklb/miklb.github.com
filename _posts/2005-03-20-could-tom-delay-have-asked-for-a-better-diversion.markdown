With reports from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51402-2005Mar20.html"> Washington Post </a> talking about the political ramifications of debating the Shiavo case, to the point of singling out Sen. Nelson (D) of FL, you can be sure that Tom DeLay is quite pleased to be the talking head in front of this issue, if for no other reason than to detract from the hot water that he seems to be avoiding in the mainstream media.  I mean, as sad a story that it is, the Atlanta killings, the missing, and now found dead young girl in FL, and the Schiavo case, the CNNs and MSNBCs of the world haven't had to resort to reporting hard news.  And that's not even taking into account the baseball hearings, the Michael Jackson trial, and the Scott Peterson sentencing.  I wonder how many young reporters are hired by the cable news agencies, thinking they are going to be the next Woodward or Bernstein, only to be relegated to gathering background on the neighbor of Scott Peterson?

I am thinking Tom DeLay should quickly become public enemy number one.  His reckless quest for the conservative right wing agenda is quickly eroding any confidence in our current leadership.
