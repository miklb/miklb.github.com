    <meta name="description" content="So I work with a company that uses BaseCamp, which is great.  Each project is easily separated, has it’s own todos, writeboards, etc.  But as someone who works with all of the projects, I get cc’ed on every message posted.  Some require my attention immediately, some will require me to be familiar with the project at some point.  I’ve never been able to manage my time recording for this internal activity, and I know I’ve lost a few dollars because of this. SO today, I’m testing out a new system.  I’ve set my mail app (Apple Mail), to only check mail once an hour.  I then set up a mailbox just for these emails, got a timer on the dashboard, that can be started and stopped, and will start the timer, read the emails, follow up on BaseCamp on any immediate issues, pause the timer, and wash, rinse, repeat the rest of the business day.  At some point I’m going to have to decide that this company has business hours, (I work from home), and not read anymore messages until the next morning, where I can track the time.  I figure after a week or so, I’ll have a pretty good idea of how much time I’m spending on this, and might actually be more productive, as I’m not constantly logging into BaseCamp to see what new has been posted, and reading messages that have already been sent to my inbox.  I also hope that after a week or two, it will be a habit, and I’ll have a pretty good average of the time spent, so I can simply log those hours either weekly based on the experiment." />

          <p>So I work with a company that uses <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">BaseCamp</a>, which is great.  Each project is easily separated, has it’s own todos, writeboards, etc.  But as someone who works with all of the projects, I get cc’ed on every message posted.  Some require my attention immediately, some will require me to be familiar with the project at some point.  I’ve never been able to manage my time recording for this internal activity, and I know I’ve lost a few dollars because of this. SO today, I’m testing out a new system.  I’ve set my mail app (Apple Mail), to only check mail once an hour.  I then set up a mailbox just for these emails, got a timer on the dashboard, that can be started and stopped, and will start the timer, read the emails, follow up on BaseCamp on any immediate issues, pause the timer, and wash, rinse, repeat the rest of the business day.  At some point I’m going to have to decide that this company has business hours, (I work from home), and not read anymore messages until the next morning, where I can track the time.  I figure after a week or so, I’ll have a pretty good idea of how much time I’m spending on this, and might actually be more productive, as I’m not constantly logging into BaseCamp to see what new has been posted, and reading messages that have already been sent to my inbox.  I also hope that after a week or two, it will be a habit, and I’ll have a pretty good average of the time spent, so I can simply log those hours either weekly based on the experiment.</p>
          <p>I read a ton of productivity blogs, (which can be counter-productive, go figure), and it seems little issues like this always trip people up.  I know that the GTD ethos is if you can do it in under 2 minutes, then do it, but that’s assuming you’re not getting 10 messages an hour, each with their own 2 minutes.</p>
          <p>Hopefully in a week or two I can report back on how the little experiment went.</p>
          <p><em>edit:</em>Funny one of those blogs I mentioned has a <a href="http://lifedev.net/2007/07/procrastination-email-deadly-combination/">little post about email and procrastination</a>, certainly appropriate.</p>
