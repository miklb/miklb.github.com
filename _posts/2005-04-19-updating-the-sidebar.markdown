Well, I've been slowly updating the sidebar, rearranging the order, added the recent visitor plugin as well as the recent  del.icio.us links.  If you are not familiar with <a href="del.icio.us">Del.icio.us, they call themselves a "social bookmark manager".</a>  Basically, it allows you to book mark a site while you are surfing, and then access the bookmark via the net, versus just the browser.  Therefore, if you use multiple browsers, or are away from your machine, you can still find the site.  Likewise, you can share them via a RSS feed.  So, I just started using it, but ultimately, it will show the most recent.  The default is 15, and once I reach that number, I'll see how it looks in the sidebar, and decide if I want to add more.  I'm really thinking about changing the header, any feedback about the current one?
