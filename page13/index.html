        Tables For Layout: Now Conforming

        <p>In case you’ve been lost in all of the SXSWi hullabaloo, or just neck deep in work like myself, it seems the W3C HTML Working Group has <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011Mar/0245.html">decided</a> using role=presentation on a table element is now conforming.  So it seems after 5 years of fighting this out in the trenches, per one  rebuttal to the proposal:</p>
<blockquote>Over the past decade or more, Web designers have been moving away from tables for layout. For a while, limitations in the market leading Web browser made this somewhat impractical for sites with complicated flexible layouts that had to be compatible with a broad range of user agents, but this is no longer the case, and new sites can avoid using tables without difficulty. Old sites won't change, but old sites are not affected by changes to conformance criteria, since they already exist. Conformance criteria only affect actively developed sites, and those can move away from tables (and many avoid using tables at all).
</blockquote>
<p>The counter argument from the working group:</p>
<blockquote>
This assertion does not mention a specific example. By contrast the authors of the proposal to make <code><table role="presention"> conforming cite gmail, facebook, yahoo mail, numerous IBM applications, and toolkits such as DOJO and YUI. As each of these are actively maintained, we find that there was insufficient evidence provided to back up this assertion.

So Facebook prevails (again)?  God help us all.

Seems like yesterday still I was purchasing my first tiny plan from A Small Orange and installing WordPress 1.2.  Now I have 2 different VPS’s, manage 100’s of WordPress sites for work on a dedicated server (<em>managed</em>, I’m not that much a masochist), and moved onto Habari for my personal sites.  Ironically or not, those that started Habari were some of the very ones that welcomed me into WordPress and were the ones that probably have helped me the most to get where I’ve gotten today.</p>

<p>So I’d like to share this virtual cake particularly with <a href="http://chrisjdavis.org/">Chis J Davis</a>, as the first theme I tore apart to customize was one of his (among many others down the road), <a href="http://asymptomatic.net/">Owen Winkler</a> for the many plugins I used to get started as well as the many hours of tutelage over the years on a variety of subjects, and <a href="http://skippy.net/">Scott Merrill</a>, because in addition to his many plugins and welcoming nature, his patience in helping walk me through setting up my first VPS.</p>

<p>There are many, many more who’ve helped me through these past six years I couldn’t begin to name them all, but please know I’m eternally grateful to each and every one.</p>

        Towards a Responsive Design
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2011-03-13T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">13 Mar 2011</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p>I am not sure I had really paid attention to the term <em>responsive design</em> when I started the redesign for this site. I just knew I wanted something that would be as readable on an iPhone as it was on my large desktop monitor.  I made some conscious decisions to remove a bunch of extraneous elements not for the mobile viewing, but I simply wanted to focus attention on what ever it was I was writing about.  Sidebars full of links, tweets, buttons and badges might have been novel 6 years ago when I started this site, but not so important to me now.</p>

<p>I also wanted to learn more about HTML5 and CSS3.  For my own site, I’m completely not interested in supporting old browsers, save for using a HTML5 polyfill for &lt; IE 9.  If someone is using IE 6, they probably don’t have much interest in what I’m sharing anyway.  So I played with some max-widths and widths based on percentage until I found something that worked for me.  Perhaps that’s not the best way to approach it, as the site really should be about those visiting, but I guess <span class="pquote-r">I made an assumption my browsers/screen resolutions/mobile devices were common enough that if it looked OK to me, it should look OK to visitors.</span>  Up until today, I was fairly happy with what I had come up with, save for the Youtube videos I’ve been posting.  I have been experimenting with using the HTML5 iframe wrapper Youtube offers, and choosing a very large version of the video.  Which wasn’t working out for smaller screens.</p>

<p>But as I’m studying more about the advanced concepts of responsive design and using media queries, I ran across Ethan Marcotte’s <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images/">fluid images</a> post.  Lo and behold, I set &lt;pre&gt;<code>iframe {max-width: 100%}</code>&lt;/pre&gt; and my video posts scale along with the surrounding content.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I will mess with this site anytime soon code or design wise, but I do intend to experiment with using the <a href="http://lessframework.com/">Less Framework</a> and possibly the intriguing <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_images_experimenting_with_context_aware_image_sizing/">context aware responsive images</a> script over on my <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking site</a>, which is a blueprint based grid design spun off of the markup of this site.  I don’t think it would take much to convert the grid to the Less Framework.  I may think about a design that’s not quite as similar to this in the process.</p>

<p>Regardless of the direction, I’d like to thank Kevin Zurawel for his <a href="http://arborwebsolutions.com/2011/03/wordcamp-miami-2011/">WordCamp Miami session on responsive design</a> and piquing my interest on the subject even more.</p>

        <p><strong>Update:</strong> The plot thickens.  <a href="http://seancoates.com">Sean Coates</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/coates/status/47642561044680706">pointed out on Twitter this morning</a> that the Twitter API announcement has been pulled, with no obvious response.  Most of the mailing list message is still available in an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/mar/14/twitter-developers-client-warning">article in the Guardian</a>.</p>

<p>First, I’m not a developer of software.  I make websites. I use Twitter. A lot sometimes. <img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/dead_bird_twitter.jpg" class="right" alt="" />  I have found the reaction to Twitter’s curious <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a">announcement in the change in their terms of service</a> interesting.  Granted, most reactions I have read are from developer types, so it may be biased.  The sentiment  could be summed up in a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GlennF/status/46442047980310528">tweet I saw today</a>, “Twitter: from #dickbar to #dickmove”. That basically Twitter added a new “feature” in their most recent mobile app that absolutely no one liked and users were abuzz with suggestions for other clients.  Rather than listen to these users (granted, they did release a minor update that apparently mitigates to a degree the trending bar, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/06/dickbar">coined by Gruber</a> the <em>dickbar</em>) they simply decided to post to a mailing list telling developers to not plan on being able to create alternate clients.  Poor timing? Possibly. They very well could have been planning this announcement for some time.  Still seems odd.</p>

<p><span class="pquote-l">But what if they had challenged themselves internally? </span>  “We are going to make such a kick ass experience for the desktop, mobile and web, users won’t bother with these imitators.”  They could have looked at who was doing great things with the iPhone and the desktop and simply hired them to make their product better.  Listened to their users to see what features these other clients were offering and <strong>make them better</strong>.  Isn’t that what free-market competition should be all about? Not, “hey, thanks for helping build up our user base, now go screw yourselves.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, Twitter really reminded me that I don’t pay for it, so I can’t really bitch about it, and should remember my goal of <a href="http://miklb.com/less-twitter-more-me">Less Twitter, more me.</a>.</p>
