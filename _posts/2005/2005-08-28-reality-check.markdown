<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/rev_wayfarer/">One Foot in the Grave</a>This shit has just got to stop.

<strong>*EDIT</strong> Just to be clear, the link is to a soldier in Iraq who passed away a couple of weeks ago.  You can read his last entry, and then in the comments, see the news.  I highly suggest reading more of entries, and look at his bio page.  That's why I said this shit has just got to stop.
