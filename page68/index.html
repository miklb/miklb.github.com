                  So a week before Bush rolls out his new budget, Congress gets to “play” with the the 9 billion dollar a year Star Wars missle defense project that has yet to work.  I’m guessing this is the whole reason DeLay was really trying to keep his job.  Meanwhile, cuts to federal student loans, medicare, and many other needed social programs keep getting slashed to the bone.  What was the budget deficit again?</p>

                <p>Well, Tiny over at<a href="http://www.tinylittledots.com">tinylittledots</a> tagged me, after his brush with Marlin Perkins, so here goes:</p>
                <p>Four jobs I’ve had:
golf course maintenance wworker, phosphate plant laborer, strip club caterer, ipod salesman</p>
                <p>Four things I want to do before I die:
drive to Alaska, sail the lesser Antilles, see the Devil Rays in the World Series, have a fish shack on the beach</p>
                <p>Four things I say a lot:
brah, dude, I quit, yes ma’am</p>
                <p>Four of my favorite foods:
scotch bonnet pepper, mango, raw fish, white beans</p>
                <p>Four people I’d like to curse:
Dick Cheney, Nixon, anyone who’s made a buck breaking a union, Hugh Culverhouse</p>
                <p>Four things I don’t trust:
insurance salespeople, seat belts, fast food drink holders, did I mention insurance salespeople?</p>
                <p>Four people from history I’d like to meet:
Copernicus, Robert E Lee, Ty Cobb, Einstein</p>
                <p>Four movies I watch over and over:

                <p>Well, I’ve been busy giving my often neglected <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking site</a> a much needed face lift, which at least I’ve been telling myself was what I needed to start posting more over there.  Lord knows I need to connect to food again.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I’m basically paralyzed by the utter lack of coverage by the “mainstream” media.  Seems the conservative powers that be have chiseled away at the “left leaning” place like CNN, where the recent announcements of Bill Bennett and, what’s his name, Glen Beck, have all but proven that the CNN is fighting to be the next FOX.
Look for a new look here at Mindless Ramblings next, with an emphasis on bringing in more content, and maybe slightly more emphasis on sharing the web design articles I find around the net.  Not to say I don’t need to get back on the hammer trail.  I’d also like to focus on Florida politics a little more, with the upcoming elections having great importance to all of us.</p>

                <p>Watching the Alito Confirmation Hearing on CSPAN, and now the second time I’ve listened to Jeff Sessions of Alabama blubber over Alito.  Who voted him head cheerleader?  Is he not intelligent enough to fake the tough questions, or too stupid to lob the easy ones for Alito to hit out of the park?  I mean, I’m not impressed with the some of the lines of questioning I’ve seen from the Democrats either, but this bafoon takes the bloody cake.  If these 16 some odd folks are the best this country can muster, we are worse shape than I thought…</p>
                <p><strong>EDIT</strong> OK, now Graham is trying to compare Alito’s confirmation hearing to crooked Republicans who have taken money from Abramhoff.  WTF??</p>
