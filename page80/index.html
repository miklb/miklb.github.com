    <p>So I’ve been looking at some Mac OS X apps, for various tasks.  I’ve started using RSS more and more, and I’m not too keen on the Sage extension for FireFox.  Mainly because of screen real estate on the ol’ ibook.  NetNewsWire seems to be the choice, and through that, I’m playing with Mars Edit, a blogging app.  So this is my fist attempt at blogging outside the web interface.  If it works out, it may be an easier way to post, if nothing more than the built in spell check.  We’ll see about the other features.  Downside is it’s not a free app, so it better well prove to invaluable, or when its trial runs out, to the curb with it.</p>

    <p>Much has been written and discussed regarding the preparedness, or lack there of, in Louisiana, and surrounding areas, especially regarding the levees.  So much to my surprise, I get an email today from <a href="http://www.factcheck.org"> Factcheck.org </a>, and it leads off with a link to the Louisiana Department of Homeland Security.  The <a href="http://www.ohsep.louisiana.gov/newsrelated/incaseofemrgencyexercise.htm">link </a> is a repost of a Times Picayune article outlining a dry run done July of 2004, before Charley and Ivan, of the effects of a <strong>Cat 3</strong> storm on the levees and underlying parishes.  Just another example of ineptness, and deceptions the administration continue to hide from.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9314188/#050916"> Brian Williams - MSNBC.com</a> Is reporting that miraculously a half hour before the Prez arrived for his big speech, the power came on in New Orleans.  And like clockwork, an hour after he left, it went off.  I’m sure there’s a <em>logical explanation</em>  I mean, those left behind don’t really need it for anything, do they?</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/12/AR2005091200642.html">‘Judges Are Not Politicians,’ Roberts Says</a>
I’m not quite sure ‘ol John is really a baseball fan.  I’m sure George Will could give a few better analogies than calling balls and strikes if he’s looking to paint himself as a straight shooter.  Anyone who watches baseball knows that sure, there’s a strike zone, but every home plate umpire calls a slightly different strike zone.  And some call a different strike zone for veteran players than rookies.  Jeter doesn’t neccessarily get the called third strike that Julio Lugo does.  And one guy may call low and outside a strike after the third, and another gives the pitcher a wider strike zone.  So therein lies the question Mr Roberts, <em>where is <strong>your</strong> strike zone</em>?  Are you going to give the pitcher the outside pitch, or are you going to call ‘em high and tight?</p>

    <p>Poor, poor, Mike Brown.  He feels humiliated that he was pulled out of New Orleans.  How bloody humiliated are the people living in conditions in the hurricane stricken region?   How much money of ours has been squandered in the lack of preparation?  And to that end, is this another “falling on the sword” loyal lap dog?  At what point will the Bush administration, and Bush specifically be held responsible for appointing lap dogs like Brown.  How many deaths will it take?  Obviously more than 2000, as Iraq has proven.  But how about the 45 dead bodies that were found in the hospital today?  Were they preventable?  I wonder how they felt about the privatization of Social Security?</p>
