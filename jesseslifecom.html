Beautiful pictures, and great insight.  He seems to be about half way through the parks, so I’m looking forward to the rest of his journey.  I’ve not been to quite as many parks as he, but reading his ventures through Rocky Mountain National Park and Badlands stirred memories of a younger, more bright-eyed miklb driving cross the the plains of North Dakota and Wyoming, down into Denver.  Having grown up with the natural beauty of Florida, the northern plains and the Rocky Mountains were another world.I’m looking forward to the rest of Jesse’s adventure, and wish him the best in his sojourn." />
