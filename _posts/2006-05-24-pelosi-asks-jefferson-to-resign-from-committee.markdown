I'm not the biggest fan of Pelosi, but I applaud the token letter she sent out.  So often one side criticizes another, yet fails to follow their own marching orders.  She's putting the Democratic Party's money where their mouth is.  While well heeled Republicans like the likes of Ney and DeLay held their posts well after annouced charges, with a ground swell of support from the White House down, the Dem's are doing what is right.  Step aside, and let the courts sort it out.  Do the right thing.  
Problem is, he <a href="http://go.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=politicsNews&storyID=12324027">won't</a>.
