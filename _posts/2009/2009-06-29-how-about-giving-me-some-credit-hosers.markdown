You'd think "Canada's best magazine", <cite>The Walrus</cite> would at least link back to my bookmarks if they are going to use my graphics in their <a href="http://www.walrusmagazine.com/blogs/2009/06/23/dfws-infinite-summer/" rel="nofollow">post about Infinite Summer</a>.  Heck, they didn't even change the name of the image from the 5x bookmark file.  Real professional Nav, real professionalâ€¦

At least they didn't just hotlink to the image in my post.
