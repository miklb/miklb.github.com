<a href="http://www.nwf.org/news/story.cfm?pageId=CF6AB0CE%2DC448%2D7D7B%2DBCFE5BF6F6A8F55D">Howl of the Wolf May be Heard Again in Northern Forest - National Wildlife Federation</a>In an attempt to once again circumvent the law, the Bush administration attempted to lump several subspecies of the Grey Wolf together to so as to take the NE Grey Wolf off the endangered list.  Luckily, a judge didn't see it that way, and ruled that there was no evidence that the research from several years ago was reversed.
In a related note, a similar case was ruled on on the West Coast regarding a species of salamander, in which the administration tried to lump several species together so as to remove them from the endangered species list.  
One can only assimilate that the reason to remove these species is so development can infringe on the habitat of these endangered species.  I'd like to know a little more about what kind of development that would be.
