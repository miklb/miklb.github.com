I didn’t watch the awards, rarely have.  I was busy with my own comedy of errors, but that’s another story.  But in some fashion, if he didn’t do it last night, Stewart has to share that award with the Bush administration.  Know that Stewart is an equal opportunity critic, and his jokes are only pointed towards those who blow it, not one party or another.But my real question is this - Does this award create an even greater undercurrent of anti-administration disdain, or does painting The Daily Show as pure comedy, and not satire, minimize the sad truth that is at the core of most of Stewart’s show?" />
