Heck, the golf course that surrounds my new house must have at least 15 ponds, let’s start counting those…ah screw the pesticides and fertilizers that filter into the ponds…”.As a Florida native, it breaks my heart every time I take a drive through an area that once used to be “swampy”, and now is condo, or subdivision.  I do enjoy playing golf, but would never trade a cypress swamp for a course.  And nor do I think my goverment should either." />
