I rarely check my stats packages anymore like awstats and the like, I simply use the stat page I created on this site with a plugin or two.  A recent referal was a google search, "how to steal wordpress theme".  Why would someone want to "steal" a theme?  Obviously they got to my site due to my blank wordpress theme, but there are hundreds of themes out there, and dozens of sites with info on how to customize them.  So why "steal".  Its not like you can't copy and paste anyone's CSS and use it on your own, the only issues are with custom php codes on the templates.  Sad really.
