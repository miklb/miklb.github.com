<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/themes/miklbs-mindless-ramblings/hurricane_flags.gif" alt="flags"/>So just checked the most recent discussions on Dennis at <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT4+shtml/060305.shtml" title="National Hurricane Center">the National Hurricane Center</a> and it's looking like a touch and go forcast for us in Central Florida.

Really not what I need at this point in time.
