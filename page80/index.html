        A Brewing Storm of a Different Nature
      </a>

    <time datetime="2005-09-24T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">24 Sep 2005</time>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092301811.html">Washington Post</a> While the nation’s eyes have been focused on Rita, and Houston’s failure to properly coordinate evacuation traffic, another storm was brewing in Republican politics.  Much in the manner that Martha Stewart was originally charged with insider trading, or something similar, Senator Bill Frist-R of Tennessee is being investigated by the Security Exchange Commission regarding sales of stock this past summer.<br />
Well it appears that Mr Frist owned a fair amount of stock in a company originally founded by his father, and over the summer, Frist order the blind trust to sell the shares.  Where the investigation comes in is the fact that soon after the sale by Frist, poor earnings reports were issued, and the price of the stock dropped significantly from the high it was when Frist sold.  There’s no indication that Frist’s family is completely divorced from the business, and there’s no indication that Frist didn’t know those in positions of power with the company.<br />
It is quite hard for me to believe that Frist simply was the recipient of good luck, and that it was purely a coincidence.  For someone who’s been discussed as a potential Presidential nominee, and currently the Senate majority leader, even the hint of misappropriateness will linger, and a discovery of wrong doing will not only ruin his political career, it will go a long way of painting the current Republican party as one of double standards and, as Dean said “made their culture of corruption the norm”.</p>

        <p>Looks like starting tomorrow, the NY Times is handcuffing its content.  Rather, handcuffing its readers.  Times Select, they’re calling it.  $40 bucks a year if you sign up by today, $50 otherwise.  Sure, some of the stuff will be free, but the good stuff, the Maureen Dowd articles, well, that’ll cost you.  However, in addition to the current content, the subscription will get you access to 100 archived articles a month.  And, if you subscribe to home delivery, then it’ll be free.  What to do, what to do.  (Anyone want to split a subscription?)</p>

        <p>So I can post with this contraption, but I don’t see all the options.  I see a thing for categories, but I can’t see how to add them.  This wouldn’t be very handy if I’m stuck with the generic default category.    I do like the idea however, of having a single interface that I post from.  So my WP Station blog, cookingwith, etc. all come from here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> OK, so I quit, and reloaded MarsEdit, and was able to “refresh” my site, and categories loaded.  Good.  I’ll add my cooking site later, to see how that handles a multitude of categories.  I’m also curious about tags, but that’s for another post.  I’m starting to like this “blogging client” situation.</p>

        <p>Well, in a round about way.  John Stewart and his show <em>The Daily Show</em> won an Emmy Last night for some kind of comedy show.  I didn’t watch the awards, rarely have.  I was busy with my own comedy of errors, but that’s another story.  But in some fashion, if he didn’t do it last night, Stewart has to share that award with the Bush administration.  Know that Stewart is an equal opportunity critic, and his jokes are only pointed towards those who blow it, not one party or another.<br />
But my real question is this - Does this award create an even greater undercurrent of anti-administration disdain, or does painting <em>The Daily Show</em> as pure comedy, and not satire, minimize the sad truth that is at the core of most of Stewart’s show?</p>

        <p>So I’ve been looking at some Mac OS X apps, for various tasks.  I’ve started using RSS more and more, and I’m not too keen on the Sage extension for FireFox.  Mainly because of screen real estate on the ol’ ibook.  NetNewsWire seems to be the choice, and through that, I’m playing with Mars Edit, a blogging app.  So this is my fist attempt at blogging outside the web interface.  If it works out, it may be an easier way to post, if nothing more than the built in spell check.  We’ll see about the other features.  Downside is it’s not a free app, so it better well prove to invaluable, or when its trial runs out, to the curb with it.</p>
