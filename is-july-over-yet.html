            The worst of it all is a dear man, a troubled genius, someone whom I was honored to call my friend, took his life this week.  I’m not too comfortable with talking about it yet, perhaps at some point I’ll blog a little more.  I’ll just say that the world took a shot to the kidneys this past Monday evening when my friend Mike O’neill took his life.

          <p>I mourn losing Miguel, and I mourn for those who held him even closer than I.  May the next part of the journey bring more solace than the last.</p>
