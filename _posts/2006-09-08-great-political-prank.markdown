What a great idea from a main stream media source.  Vanity Fair has a fake cover for <em>The Weekly Standard</em> which dogs the current efforts in Iraq.  Simply detach the fake cover from the Vanity Fair, and fold it over a copy on the newsstand, sit back, and watch the shock of the next neocon that approaches the newsstand.  Brilliant!
