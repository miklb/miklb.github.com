Well, with the holiday weekend, shark attacks, O'Connor stepping down, and the general lack of focus from the main stream media, the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek/" title="The Rove Factor-msnbc.com">Karl Rove story </a>hasn't gotten any traction, just yet.  

If Rove and the administration avoid this hot potato, I think it could easily be said we have  a new "Teflon" president.  One wonders how far this one could go, as there isn't really much further up the ladder you can go from Rove.  And now that he's Deputy Chief of Staff, this means he's the White House.  Another good read is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/lawrence-odonnell/roves-i-did-not-inhale_3637.html"> Lawrence Odonnell's piece</a>.  Basically pointing out that Rove's lawyer is already painting an escape route for Rove's leak.
Stay tuned...
