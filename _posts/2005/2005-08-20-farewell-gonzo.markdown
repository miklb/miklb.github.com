A farewell bang is set this evening for Hunter S Thompson's remains.  

Hope it's a blast.  To have friends like that, he had to have been everything we think him to be.  I even forgive him for his pathetic bashing of the Bucs before the Superbowl.  But what better team than the Raiders, the perennial bad boys, for Thompson to be a fan of.
