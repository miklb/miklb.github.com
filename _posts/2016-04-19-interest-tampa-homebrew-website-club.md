summary: Quick web survey gauging interest in a Tampa homebrew website club.
---

Gauging interest in Tampa to see if anyone would be up for joining a
[Homebrew Website Club](https://indiewebcamp.com/events/2016-04-06-homebrew-website-club). A lot of tech folks have vey neglected personal sites and this would give folks a chance to get together and talk tech and work on their personal site and pet proejcts. Platform agnostic (read, not another WordPress meetup) so open to anyone. If interested ping me on [Twitter @miklb](https://twitter.com/miklb) for now and I'll sort out finding a location and setting up a time. Only looking for a couple of people to get off the ground.
