                <p>Sort of tongue in cheek title, but while pumping gas this week, the thought crossed my mind, do gas stations “fix” the pump so it’s impossible to stop on a round number?  Obviously this only applies to those who pay at the pump with some sort of plastic, but I’d guess that’s a majority of Americans.<br />
                  Think about it, a lot of people have some form of OCD weirdness with numbers, and round things to the dollar.  With many years of restaurant experience, I’ve seen it time and time again, people  rounding the bill to the nearest dollar when adding a tip, even if that means shorting the server.  I mean, what really does it matter if your bill is $43.61 instead of $43?<br />
                  So back to the pump.  Could it be a trick to get people to spend more money at their pump by making it nearly impossible to stop on the dollar?  Think about it.  You go to the pump, intending on putting $15 in the tank.  As the pump nears $15, you slow down, and do the little shuffle of squeeze, stop, look, squeeze stop, look, “damn, $15.01”, and the proceed to go to the next dollar.  That could easily happen again at $16, and now you’re at $17.  Say it stops.  You put the pump away, go about your business, not thinking about the extra $2 you spent that you didn’t intend to.  If that occurs with 60% of the customers, that could be an extra $1000 or more a day.  That’s a third of a million dollars a year, easily at the minimum, that they take in that we never intended to spend at that gas station.  So do you think they are doing it?</p>

                  Trying to catch up on the news after working 35+ hours in 3 days is tough, but this article caught my interest.  Seems the Bush administration has appointed someone who is actually listening, and taking action in preserving our national parks.  I strongly believe the parks should be restricted in the use of motorized vehicles, for many reasons.  I can only hope the draft is taken as it stands, and I intend on adding my comments formally, as there’s a 90 day window to do so.  I’ll update after I make my voice heard.</p>

                  So a supervisor of elections uncovers more security issues with electronic voting machines, and our elected leader’s answer is to pass a bill preventing independent testing of the equipment.  Real bloody smart.  I’m all for technological advancements in all areas of government, but I also want to know that the technology is secure.  Which means testing, and more testing.  Rather than a knee jerk reaction and getting into bed with a company because of questionable lobbying practices, or the like.  I really hope this bill has limited support, and state reps shoot this down quickly.</p>

                  Mark Cuban, blogger and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is blogging the NBA finals.  I have to say, his blogging has made it infectious to be a Mav’s fan for the finals.  I’m not really a basketball fan, but have a few friends who’ve been watching the playoffs, so I’ve followed along.  I also came across Mark Cuban’s blog while checking out some feeds while investigating over at <a href="http://share.opml.org">Share Your OPML</a> as the playoffs started.  So I’ve been following his blogs while keeping an eye to the playoffs.  It’s fun to see things transpire as they have.</p>
