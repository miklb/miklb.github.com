Dear Santa,

Remember way back when I was first starting out cooking, and I asked you for a copy of Harold McGee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Cooking-Science-Lore-Kitchen/dp/0684800012/sr=1-1/qid=1165687755/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-9313929-1151264?ie=UTF8&s=books">On Food and Cooking</a>.  I was just a hack kid in the kitchen, desperate to <a href="http://www.essaylib.com/" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none; font-weight: inherit; border:none;" class="ass">learn more</a> about the science behind the art that had all but consumed me.  You quickly obliged, and I took that knowledge on a journey that I wouldn't trade for anything.
Now, that I've grown, my interests and profession are taking another turn, and again I turn to you to bring me a book that will do for me what Harold's did for me back then.  <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2006/12/win_an_ipod_nano_with_css_mastery_this_christmas/index.php">Andy Budd</a> wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/1590596145&tag=blogography-21&camp=1634&creative=6738">CSS Mastery</a>, yet another brilliant insight into the "science" behind the "art" that has taken me onto my most current journey.  I've muddled my way through so far, but I trust that with the guidance this book offers, I can excel in this medium in a similar manner that I did with my last discipline.

Michael

P.S.  If you happen to find room in your bag to add a new Mac Book Pro and a 20" cinema display, I promise to be a really, really, good boy.
