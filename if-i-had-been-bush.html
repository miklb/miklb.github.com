<meta name="description" content="Ah, the trials and tribulations of off line life vs on line life…Anyway, I was sitting with some friends, talking geek talk, and made a political analogy off the top of my head, that after second thought, wasn’t a bad idea, in some contexts. The idea was this…if the right wing machine was so-o-o-o worried about one Hillary Rodham-Clinton running for president, and the effects a Hillary presidency would have on the agenda, then why not appoint her to the Supreme Court? She was a Washington lawyer at one time, and there was discussion of appointing a non judge anyways. It would have totally taken the wind out of the lefts sails, and taken her out of any running for presidency. Sure, she would have been some what influential on the Supreme Court, but she would have been only one of nine. Then they could have put a serious conservative to replace Rehnquist, and set a conservative to be Chief Justice.">

      <p>Ah, the trials and tribulations of off line life vs on line life…Anyway, I was sitting with some friends, talking geek talk, and made a political analogy off the top of my head, that after second thought, wasn’t a bad idea, in some contexts.  The idea was this…if the right wing machine was <em>so-o-o-o</em> worried about one Hillary Rodham-Clinton running for president, and the effects a Hillary presidency would have on the agenda, then why not appoint <em>her</em> to the Supreme Court?  She was a Washington lawyer at one time, and there was discussion of appointing a non judge anyways.  It would have totally taken the wind out of the lefts sails, and taken her out of any running for presidency.  Sure, she would have been some what influential on the Supreme Court, but she would have been only one of nine.  Then they could have put a serious conservative to replace Rehnquist, and set a conservative to be Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Ah well, it was a common sense and Microsoft analogy anyways…</p>
