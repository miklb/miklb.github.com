Who told Wolf Blitzer that he was a hard hitting journalist?  His interview this afternoon of Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez was full of weighted questions with zero, nada, zilch follow-up.  On the surface, the question seemed legitimate, however, after the canned response (obviously the questions had been vetted), <em>Wolf</em> simply took Gonzalez's answer and moved on to the next lolipop question.  At least Russert and Mathews push a little further with the question before moving on.  A good read on the subject, IMO, is Katrina Vanden Huevel's <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?bid=7&pid=4659">comments</a> on Bob Costas, of all people, filling in for another softy, Larry King.  It makes me laugh when righties call CNN a "left-wing media organization".  What does that make Katrina and her magazine <em>The Nation</em>?  A revolutionary media organization?
