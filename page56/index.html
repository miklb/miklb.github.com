                <p>I’m sure I’ve touched on this topic before, but after the reboot, I’ve found myself wanting to simply “blog” more.  I still have my cooking site, and mentally beat myself up for not using it more, and wonder if simply marrying it with this site is the best idea.  I wouldn’t feel so compelled to produce content for two different sites, as well as keep up with <a href="http://wpstation.com">WordPress Station</a>.  I could simply write about food, and food topics interspersed with my political rants, web finds, and occasional fishing stories.  (Those have been few and far between for sure).<br />
                  I read more and more blogs these days, and that’s exactly what I’m finding, that the sites are not just specific to one topic, that they truly are extensions of the author.  So in a given week, a story about a loved one, web standards, a sporting event, and dinner out can all be intertwined into one site.  As I type this, I feel that is where my direction will go, it just seems to make “sense”.  Less focus on <em>having to</em> blog about a certain topic, and more on <em>wanting to</em>.  Because, in the end, isn’t that what it’s all about?</p>

                <p>I’ve been a home owner for a little over 5 years, and for the most part, haven’t thought twice about the decision.  That is, until the toilet acts up.  That damn thing has been nothing short of the proverbial thorn in my side from day one.  Leaking, not flushing, overfilling, you name it, I’ve dealt with it.  And being the “manly man” that I am, I’ve done all the repairs myself, even when I’ve made huge mistakes like chipping the tank where the fill valve seats, and having to hunt down some kind of epoxy/resin to fill in the chips so the tank would fill and not leak.<br />
                  No matter how many times I’ve replaced the ballcock, refill valve, handle, lever, 3 months later this thing stops working properly.  I feel like I’m a Marine with an M16 when it comes to the thing.  I could take it apart and put it back together blindfolded.  Today wasn’t <em>too</em> bad, I had to take the ballcock apart, and clean a little gasket inside, reseat it, and adjust the lever to allow the float to rise.
So set the timer, by August, something will <strong>have</strong> to be replace.</p>

                <p>I’ve updated my <a href="http://www.miklb.com/rss">RSS reader</a>, <a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarius</a>, to the latest SVN.  Which means the latest code.  Not always a great idea, but this version has been in development for some time, and about to be released as .5.4.  I’d like to thank <a href="http://kalsey.com/2006/03/gregarius/">Adam Kalsey</a> for his help via IRC, and for his theme.  I really want to look closer at the the theme system, I really think it’s similar to WordPress’s system.  Adam’s theme is definitely an improvement in a lot of ways over the default theme, but I’d like to maybe soften it up a bit.  For some reason, my eyes just don’t work with the grays.  Especially the header image.
While I’m on the subject, I was checking out Dave Winer’s <a href="http://share.opml.org/">Share your OPML</a>.  I haven’t added my OPML <em>yet</em>, but I did discover Mark Cuban’s <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/">Blog Maverick</a>.  I’m not a big basketball fan, but of all the interviews I’ve seen/read, I’ve found him interesting.  Reading his posts left me with a similar feeling.  I’ve always secretly wished he would buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from the Glazers.  Who knows.  Anyway, I’m off to the OPML site to find more feeds for my reading pleasure.</p>
