    <p>My previous post mentions BaseCamp and GTD, what I’d really, really, (no, really) like is a way to export my todo’s from BaseCamp.  Most specifically, to the new Omni Focus, or even better, iCal, which then could be exported to some other format, be it Google Calendar, which supports Remember the Milk, or, as I mentioned, Omni Focus. (Which reminds me, I haven’t been using it as much as I’d like, due to the the subject of this post).  Perhaps if my new system works out, I can use the quick add from Mail.app to OF as part of the system…hmm, might just work.</p>

    <p>So quickly I’ve discovered (or been reminded), that using a Mail.app rule to move right out of the Inbox removes the notice in the dock.  Not a big deal, but if I’m away from the computer when the hour is up, I might not see that I have new work email, so I’ve employed <a href="http://www.tonyallevato.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=29">Mail Badger</a>, so that I can create a custom icon notice in the Mail icon in the dock just for that work’s email.  So far so good though with the system.</p>

    <p>It seems that Technorati finally was able to index the site, as well as fix the issue with the site regarding new claims for sites not supported with the their quick claim.  Not sure why I was actually waiting for the claim before blogging more here, but it worked out, as I was out with a medical issue the past few weeks, so timing is everything.  I really look forward to blogging, and now I have no excuses.</p>

<p>Seems Habari can’t use Technorati’s quick claim process, so I was asked to paste a little code in a post, so the claim process could proceed.  Hopefully this will be quick.  I will say that Lev with Technorati was very nice and apologetic regarding the issue, and offered any more assistance necessary.</p>
