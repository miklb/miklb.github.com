<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55268-2005Mar21.html">New EPA Mercury Rule Omits Conflicting Data (washingtonpost.com)</a>So as the President and his henchmen argue the sanctity of life, the facts of Bush's law in TX about persons on life support not being able to pay for their treatment being removed, depsite families wishes, I find this article at the Washington Post.  The kicker, for me is this <blockquote>because the cost to industry already far exceeded the public health payoff.</blockquote>  So potentially, my life is not valuable enough in terms of corporate costs, however there's some screwed up sanctity of life for some woman who hasn't been able to put a glass to her mouth and drink, and wouldn't know it if Bush himself shot her up with mercury directly?
To not even acknowledge the study, after funding it, is obviously a ploy to hide the real benefits of stricter mercury controls.  Not to mention the shear volume it would speak to the global community.
