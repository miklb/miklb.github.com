                  Bush’s response has been so far to not comment, and send his entire staff, including Rove, to ethics class.  A whole hour long on how to handle classified documents.  That’s the best he’s got?  Not quite the “heads will roll if anyone in my administration was involved” attitude his little John Wayne act tried.  I’m sure though the Republican’s will applaud such a move.

                <p>With all the buzz around the net discussing Akismet, which, to me, is just another hype for wordpress.com, I came across <a href="http://error.wordpress.com/2005/10/25/bad-behavior-2-roadmap/">IOerror’s discussion</a> of his roadmap for Bad Behaivor 2.  Again, people are praising Akismet as the second coming of Christ, and if that is the case, then the combination of Spam Karma and Bad Behavior is the first coming.  Along with the roadmap, IOError discusses the reality of what it will take for him to be able to knock out the new version, CA$H.  Quite understandable, hell, this blogger had to go back to his prior profession for the exact same reason.  But the case of Bad Behavior is simple, if 100 bloggers such as this one has already done and donated a mere $10, we would in essence be hiring a full time spam fighter.  So let this be a challenge to other bloggers, jump on the bandwagon and use Kismet, or support the developer who set the standard in the first place.  I’m from the school of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”, so therefore I’m not disabling my two working anti-spam plugins to try the flavor of the week, I’d rather see the BB2 come down the pipe a month or so from now.  It’s up to you now.</p>

                <p>I’ve managed to go through my first 140 or so posts and add tags via the Ultimate Tag Warrior plugin, so the concept of “categories” is now all but moot here at Mindless Ramblings.  Hence the tag “cloud” in the middle.  I’ve recently purchased a new camera phone with the hopes of moblogging some, but the flickr gallery plugin I’m trying to use is beta, maybe more like alpha, but hopefully I’ll get it to work, until then, don’t click the gallery link.  I did do a little modification to the squible default style.css, but aside from a different image on the lead post and some colors changes, it’s straight out of the box.  It’s such a different theme, that until I work through it more, it’s kinda hard to start changing things.  Again, stay out of the gallery please, it’s not quite ready, but I may need it live to help trouble shoot the install.</p>
