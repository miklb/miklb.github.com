That will accomplish nothing, but strap an already over burden school system with legal fees and potentially worse." />

          <p>Clearly something needs to be clarified about how to handle similar situations, and at least in this area, better training and incentives for drivers need to be in place, as anytime something “scary” or worse happens, its a substitute driver at the wheel.</p>
