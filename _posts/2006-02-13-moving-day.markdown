If you made it this far, then the dns have populated, and you are viewing the site on the new server.  My hosting was about to be up, not to mention I was having trouble with the old host, in the sense they didn't seem to care if I renewed, especially in regards to the manner they handled the last two tickets I opened.  I understand things happen, but don't treat me like a child or idiot.  
More about the new hosting later, anyway, pardon the dust, and the half done look.  I need to get the rest of the site back up, meaning the cooking and my sandbox.  After that, some TLC to the home office. I did manage to finally update to 2.0, and the only problem so far seems to be a conflict with an RSS plugin and the built in magpie RSS for Squible (which might get the door, we'll see).

<strong>EDIT</strong> I just couldn't take Squible anymore.  It's a great theme, and there are aspects I do like, it's just not me.  So I'm adapting a design I've been working on for something else for the time being, and will continue to tweak over the next few days.  I hope it doesn't interupt anyone's viewing of the more popular posts.
