              <p>Currently I’m running the latest stable version of <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a> on an inexpensive VPS that is only running Ngnix and Sqlite. No Apache, no Mysql. That part will stay.  From there, I’m just not quite sure, other than I will not have a filter on my content ever again.</p>
              <p>For the one or two people who stumble into this new incarnation, I am no longer doing any type of web work/development professionally, save for a business that I’m helping <em>ehem</em>, “bootstrap”. I’ll be writing more about that for sure, suffice to say this <em>NY Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24labor-t.html?_r=5&amp;pagewanted=all">article</a> touches on where I’ve been mentally and professionally the last couple of months.</p>
