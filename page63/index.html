            <p>When I first started using RSS, I choose <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire Lite</a> and was quite pleased with the functionality.  I then discovered <a href="http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html">Vienna</a> an open source, free, aggregator.  Which  I liked a little better than  NetNewsWire.  I then went on my merry way adding and subtracting feeds, and keeping up with multiple sites with no problems.  Then I got my new desktop computer, all snazzy with OS Tiger, and have begun using it much, much, more than I ever did the old one.  Thus a dilemma began, how to keep track of what has been read and what hasn’t when switching from desktop to laptop.  Enter <a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarious</a>.  I can host it on my server, and access it from both machines, and, voilá , no need to use a desktop aggregator, no need to deal with someone elses hosted aggregator, and ads, I’m sure.  It was quite easy to install (though I did have to manually import the sql database info), and easily imported my opml file from vienna, so all my feeds were picked up, and I never lossed a beat.  You can take a look at my feeds at <a href="http://www.miklb.com/rss">Miklb’s Feeds</a>.  Right now it’s the vanilla default install, but I intend to give it some customization (like I have free time right now…)
So, take a look, maybe you’ll find a feed worth adding to your reader of choice, or maybe you’ll decide to give Gregarius a shot yourself.</p>

Now she’s seen clearly in bed with an admitted criminal who’s been found to illegally donate to her campaign, she’s been documented to have worked with/campaigned with/for ol’ Duke Cunningham, who’s admitted to taking kick backs/bribes.  If it looks like a circus clown, and talks like a circus clown…nah, that’s not fair to the memory of Emmitt Kelly.
My only worry is that she won’t run this fall, and Bill Nelson will actually have to campaign against someone.</p>

            <p>As much as I love food, and cooking, and know that real restaurants are out there with caring owners and concerned staff, the combination of my hard-headedness and bad luck, I’ve not worked in one in a long time.  I loathe working in a restaurant right now, and pray for the day that I discover that I really can make a living working with the web, or some other career opens up, but until then, I’m in it.
And with that off my chest, I really had a bad night, and was looking forward to getting home, and watching my favorite hockey team take on their in-state rival. (yeah, another sports post, go figure).  So I settle in on the couch with some munchies and fire up the DVR, and no sooner than the game starts, it was over.  And it was <a href="http://www.tbo.com/sports/lightning/MGBDTF869KE.html">downhill from there.</a>  So thanks Lightning for reminding me that I might not have been the only one who had a bad day, and that you’ve got to put it behind you, learn what you can from your mistakes, and accept the fact that somedays, it’s just not your day.  Here’s to a better tomorrow, and a run for the Cup.</p>
