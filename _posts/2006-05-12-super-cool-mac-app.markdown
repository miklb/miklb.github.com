If all the other nifty things your mac does isn't enough to impress your friends, then the next time you have a party and the music is pumping out of your computer to the stereo wirelessly via the airport express, have this little app running on the desk top, and tell your friends to go pick out an album.
<a href="http://www.steelskies.com/coverflow/">Cover Flow</a> takes your album art from itunes, and makes a virtual CD rack, where you can move from one album to the next looking at the cover, just like the old days :D.  You can click on the album directly in the app, it launches in itunes, and you can can continue to scroll through the collection.
