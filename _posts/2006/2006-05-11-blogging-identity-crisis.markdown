I'm sure I've touched on this topic before, but after the reboot, I've found myself wanting to simply "blog" more.  I still have my cooking site, and mentally beat myself up for not using it more, and wonder if simply marrying it with this site is the best idea.  I wouldn't feel so compelled to produce content for two different sites, as well as keep up with <a href="http://wpstation.com">WordPress Station</a>.  I could simply write about food, and food topics interspersed with my political rants, web finds, and occasional fishing stories.  (Those have been few and far between for sure).  
I read more and more blogs these days, and that's exactly what I'm finding, that the sites are not just specific to one topic, that they truly are extensions of the author.  So in a given week, a story about a loved one, web standards, a sporting event, and dinner out can all be intertwined into one site.  As I type this, I feel that is where my direction will go, it just seems to make "sense".  Less focus on <em>having to</em> blog about a certain topic, and more on <em>wanting to</em>.  Because, in the end, isn't that what it's all about?
