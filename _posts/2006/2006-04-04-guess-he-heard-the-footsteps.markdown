New services around the country are reporting that good ol' Tom "The Hammer" DeLay is stepping down from his bid to run again for Congress.  Couldn't be better news to me.  I just wonder why it's taken so long.  Perhaps he got advanced warning of the extent of Tom Rudy's cooperation, and pending charges that will be harder to shake.  
I also wonder if those who donated to his re-election can ask for a refund, and how the successor is chosen.  A run off between the remaining 3 candidates?
I also wonder if Bush and the Rove machine will continue to stand by their man, or will attempt to distance themselves and the White House from DeLay.
I'm sure some answers will come sooner than later, but that's at least one perpetrator of the culture of corruption that won't be influencing the laws of our country, and won't be perpetuating the good ol' boy network on Capitol Hill come this fall.
