<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/15/politics/15delay.html?pagewanted=2">The New York Times > Washington > From DeLay's Colleagues, Strong, if Wary, Support</a>How long can this guy keep dodging bullets?  Even his side is calling them "brush fires", have they not heard the saying, "where there's smoke, there's fire."

But I'm sure the powers that be on the other side of the aisle will know when they've used up Delay, and will cast him aside to some high paying corporate job, and find some other puppet to manipulate the system.
