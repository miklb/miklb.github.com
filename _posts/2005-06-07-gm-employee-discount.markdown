So I've been seeing these commercials for GM giving everyone the same deal on cars as employees.  I sorta thought it was a interesting angle.  Then I see in the papers today they plan on laying off 25,000 employees.  So the deal really was a way to broker some "goodwill" to soften the announcement?  Or was it a way of cutting out one more thing in their severance package?  Either way, looks shitty to me.  Nice one GM.
