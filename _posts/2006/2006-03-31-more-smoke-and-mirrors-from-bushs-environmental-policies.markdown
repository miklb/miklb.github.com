I'd really like to meet the genius who came up with this idea.  "Hey, we can turn a negative into a positive if we simply start counting any puddle as wetlands.  Heck, the golf course that surrounds my new house must have at least 15 ponds, let's start counting those...ah screw the pesticides and fertilizers that filter into the ponds...".
As a Florida native, it breaks my heart every time I take a drive through an area that once used to be "swampy", and now is condo, or subdivision.  I do enjoy playing golf, but would never trade a cypress swamp for a course.  And nor do I think my goverment should either.
