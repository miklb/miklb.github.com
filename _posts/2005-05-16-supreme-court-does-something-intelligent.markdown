From the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/16/AR2005051600441.html?sub=AR">Washington Post </a>, and declaring it against the Constitution's Commerce clause, wineries can now ship interstate.  Soon, I'll be able to get one of my favorite <a href="http://www.chappellet.com/html/dry_chenin_blanc.html">wines  </a> of all time, without hunting high and low.
Score one for the winos.
