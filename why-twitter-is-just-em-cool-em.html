                And ch-ching was heard in the land. And the (not citizen) journalists heard it, and it got them pecking into their Blackberries and laptops.

And then the writers and designers, ashamed at rubbing shoulders with common humanity, discovered the 140-character Tweet and the Tumblr post. No stink of commerce, no business model, nothing that could even charitably be called content, and best of all, no effort. Peck, peck, send. 
              </blockquote>
              <p>I discovered “blogging” and the culture surrounding it just before what I assume is the time when “…(not citizen) journalists heard it…”.  It was an exciting discovery, which ultimately lead me to the career I (usually) enjoy now.  And as much I probably contribute to the <em>not citizen</em> “pecking at their Blackberries and laptops”, and as much as Twitter has long lost the purity of “not having a stink of commerce”, I personally enjoy the freedom of 140 character rants, without any concern whether anyone is reading them or not.  I use Twitter solely because there’s a certain cathartic release in firing off something like “trying to explain browser differences on form styling is like swimming in 3 day old mashed potatoes”.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that wasn’t the original intent of this post.  Rather, there really is another reason I enjoy Twitter.  It’s a compelling way to get a glimpse into the lives of people that you’ve crossed paths with and whom you find interesting or share common interests with, but haven’t had the opportunity to really get to know.</p>
              <p>Then something like today happens.  I’d been away from technology the last twenty four hours, and wanted a light hearted way of catching up with what was going on in the world, and the web in particular.  Plus, there’s always a few good laughs along the way (see <a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">@hotdogsladies</a>).</p>
              <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/cscott_twitter.jpg" alt="twitter" class="left" />Then this tweet came across Twitterific.  First, I’ve not really ever met either Chris or Sean.  <a href="http://iamzed.com/">Chris</a> I began following after he began following me at blogOrlando3.  I wasn’t even sure who he was until the brief encounter we had at the after party.  (Chris was the lucky guy handing out the drink tickets.  Everyone’s best friend for at least 5 minutes.)  Afterward I realized that he helped <a href="http://hyku.com/blog/">Josh Hallet</a> with the the conference.  I, like many people, truly enjoyed blogOrlando, the vibe surrounding it, and felt anyone who put that together or were involved I’d like to eventually get to know.  So I follow several people that were at blogOrlando, including Chris, Josh, and <a href="http://twitter.com/jharr">Jeremy</a>.</p>
              <p><a href="http://seancoates.com/">Sean</a> I first encountered in the Habari IRC channel when he came along looking for help with getting some patches committed so he could fix the s9y importer and migrate his blog to Habari.  Always excited for a new user/community member, I committed his patches, and soon noticed him hanging around the channel.  Long story short, Sean is now part of the PMC of Habari, and can commit his own damn patches  now ;-).</p>
              <p>My point?  I guess after writing this I don’t have something profound to say.  I’d just never seen a correspondence between Chris or Sean on Twitter in the time I’ve been following both.  Certainly I don’t know either well enough to know if they actually have met, which wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility for two developers (who also share a love of great beer, another reason I enjoy their tweets) to have met.</p>
              <p>But it gave me one of those smiles and six degrees of separation moments.</p>
              <p>Oh, did I mention it gave me a smile after a couple of shit weeks?</p>
