            <p>I stumbled upon this quote from Thomas Keller a few days ago, and it’s been haunting me ever since.</p>
            <blockquote>It’s not about passion. Passion is something that we tend to overemphasize, that we certainly place too much importance on. Passion ebbs and flows. To me, it’s about desire. If you have constant, unwavering desire to be a cook, then you’ll be a great cook. If it’s only about passion, sometimes you’ll be good and sometimes you won’t. You’ve got to come in every day with a strong desire. With passion, if you see the first asparagus of the springtime and you become passionate about it, so much the better, but three weeks later, when you’ve seen that asparagus every day now, passions have subsided. What’s going to make you treat the asparagus the same? It’s the desire.</blockquote>
            <p><span class="small">Via <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672282/thomas-keller-on-why-passion-shouldn-t-drive-you">Fast Company</a> </span></p>
            <p>While I certainly can relate to the culinary element of this – I think I had the desire – it strikes a nerve more so in my <em>career</em> as a web developer. I think I had the passion, just not the desire. Three weeks after the first time I used some new tool or trick, it lost its luster. I didn’t get excited, I wasn’t the type of person to want to get up early and do it all over again. So I spent the last year or so of being a developer chasing the newest shiny thing so I didn’t have to deal with the everyday.</p>
            <p>Even after reading this, I’m not sure it would have struck a nerve if I didn’t think I’d found a new profession that I do have the desire for. Long after the bloom is off the rose, I’m still excited to do the routine.</p>

            <p>I target redfish routinely in Tampa Bay, and while I often fall back to the classic blackened redfish, this sounds like a nice change of pace. I might tweak it by using a little wine, probably a riesling, but otherwise, sounds like a perfect spring dish.</p>

            <p>I originally started this blog 8 years ago. A lot has happened since then. While I learned a lot building out the last design, a lot has changed regarding HTML, CSS and more so, responsive design.</p>
            <p>I will try to update with what I’m working on as I continue this, rest assured, it’s going to be very rough around the edges, but that’s a sure fire way of making sure I complete this. I’m not even sure if comments are working, or I’d say leave a message if you see something you’d like to see more of, or is so horribly broken the site doesn’t work.</p>
            <p>I’m still trying to figure out how to bring back my old content, and am leaning now towards manually moving over posts that I’d like to have around for posterity. Doing so manually sounds tedious, but will allow me to clean up the markup.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ll probably do the same with all of my old food blog posts as well. I’m using a little plugin that <a href="http://asymptomatic.net">Owen</a>  whipped up for using post-formats. Similar to how WordPress does, but much better in my opinion. I’ll definitely write more about that after I get the kinks worked out.</p>
            <p><strong>Update</strong> Seems I can’t remove localhost from the free pictos account I set up and add the live domain. Waiting on support, but not holding my breath. Not willing to pay for the service until I can see it live. Might start looking for alternatives. Also, reading their support threads, seems like a big headache.</p>
            <p><strong>Update 2</strong> Ran into some issues, switching back over to previous theme for now.</p>
