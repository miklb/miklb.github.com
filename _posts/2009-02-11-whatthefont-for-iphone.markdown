I've often seen an advertisement while out and and about and wondered what the font face was, now I've got a fighting chance to find out.  Currently free and a .1 release,  one can only imagine it will improve.

The app basically allows you to take a pic, use your finger to crop the image to just highlight the text, and then it uploads the font to their server.  It then does what the web app does, compares the image with some kind of OCR and has you confirm that the corresponding characters are correct.  Once you approve the recognition, it returns the font(s).

Pretty nifty little app if you ask me.
