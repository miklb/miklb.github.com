Yes, I haven't blogged in a while, and yes, I've been busy cooking for a living again.  However that doesn't mean I don't intend to continue blogging, nor do I completely ignore the news.  That said, I was shocked when I heard on the news today that U2 was doing a fundraiser for Rick Santorum.  Then I read over at <a href="http://joetrippi.com">Joe Trippi's site </a> that ol' Santorum and the conservative news blogs got the message wrong.<blockquote>Santorum . . . you may want to wipe those eggs off of your face</blockquote>
And was just starting to think the world was really slipping off its axis. Whew!  Not just yet.
