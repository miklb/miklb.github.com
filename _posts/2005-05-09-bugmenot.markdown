Ever come across a news article that requires a subscription.  And did you find yourself saying, "I don't really want to subscribe to the Knoxville News and remember ANOTHER account."   Now you don't.  You can go to <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com">BugMeNot.com</a>  enter the URL and it will provide you with an account login.  Now I personally have subscribed to a few papers, specifically NY Times and LA Times, as I find myself referencing those sites weekly, if not daily.  However, there are occasions that I pass on an article because I don't want to bother registering.  Excellent idea.
