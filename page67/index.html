            <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/default.mspx">Internet Explorer 7: Beta 2 Preview</a>I never thought I’d herald the release of an IE product, and after testing it I may not be so interested, but if you’ve ever sat up until 5am trying to hack IE bugs in a completely valid site while your client in California keeps saying, “In IE…”, then the prospects of some of those bugs being gone is well, worth the annoucement.
              <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/29/445242.aspx">Annouced last July on the developer’s blog</a>, these bugs are supposed to be addressed  in beta 2.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Peekaboo bug</li>
              <li>Guillotine bug</li>
              <li>Duplicate Character bug</li>
              <li> Border Chaos</li>
              <li>No Scroll bug</li>
              <li> 3 Pixel Text Jog</li>
              <li> Magic Creeping Text bug</li>
              <li>Bottom Margin bug on Hover</li>
              <li> Losing the ability to highlight text under the top border</li>
              <li> IE/Win Line-height bug</li>
              <li> Double Float Margin Bug</li>
              <li> Quirky Percentages in IE</li>
              <li>Duplicate indent</li>
              <li>Moving viewport scrollbar outside HTML borders</li>
              <li> 1 px border style</li>
              <li>Disappearing List-background</li>
              <li>Fix width:auto</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And I’ll say a bug I spent several hours hacking last night is fixed in beta2.  Good sign (it was a lesser known a:hover background sticking bug, for those who care).</p>
            <p>Like I said, maybe a little less cursing now.</p>

            <p>…and will be hitting Dr Dave’s PayPal later today.  The last couple of days, I had noticed I was getting S P A M emails, that <em>seemed</em> legit.  But further investigation, revealed that it was bunk.  First giveaway  was the “Great Site”, but the kicker would be a fishing site commenting on a fishing article.  They are searching technorait, or google blog search, and finding keywords and then hitting.  So, some what frustrated, I delete, and wonder if <a href="http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/">Bad Behavior</a> and <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/">Spam Karma</a> are working.  Low and behold I go to delete some more via SK, and I’m greeted by a message saying it’s not just me with spam getting through, and offering up some solutions, with an assurance that there are more tricks to SK to squash the recent wave of Spammers if it persists.  Well worth a trip to Dr. Dave’s site and donate what ever you can, be it a month’s intake of Google Ads, or $10, or more, if you can spare it.  I’ve already done so with Bad Behavior, and so should you, especially if you spend any where the time I’ve spent the last two days cleaning 3 blogs of spam.  The donation is well worth the time it would save.</p>

              So a week before Bush rolls out his new budget, Congress gets to “play” with the the 9 billion dollar a year Star Wars missle defense project that has yet to work.  I’m guessing this is the whole reason DeLay was really trying to keep his job.  Meanwhile, cuts to federal student loans, medicare, and many other needed social programs keep getting slashed to the bone.  What was the budget deficit again?</p>

            <p>Well, Tiny over at<a href="http://www.tinylittledots.com">tinylittledots</a> tagged me, after his brush with Marlin Perkins, so here goes:</p>
            <p>Four jobs I’ve had:
golf course maintenance wworker, phosphate plant laborer, strip club caterer, ipod salesman</p>
            <p>Four things I want to do before I die:
drive to Alaska, sail the lesser Antilles, see the Devil Rays in the World Series, have a fish shack on the beach</p>
            <p>Four things I say a lot:
brah, dude, I quit, yes ma’am</p>
            <p>Four of my favorite foods:
scotch bonnet pepper, mango, raw fish, white beans</p>
            <p>Four people I’d like to curse:
Dick Cheney, Nixon, anyone who’s made a buck breaking a union, Hugh Culverhouse</p>
            <p>Four things I don’t trust:
insurance salespeople, seat belts, fast food drink holders, did I mention insurance salespeople?</p>
            <p>Four people from history I’d like to meet:
Copernicus, Robert E Lee, Ty Cobb, Einstein</p>
            <p>Four movies I watch over and over:
Glen Garry Glen Ross, Reservoir Dogs, Taxi Driver, Dog Day Afternoon</p>
            <p>Four people I’m tagging:
              <a href="http://www.bonniewren.com">Bonnie</a>, <a href="http://www.7milesdown.com/">Trench</a>, <a href="http://www.tamba2.org.uk/T2/index.php">Podz</a>,  and er, well, hmm, I’ll get that last one…</p>

            <p>Well, I’ve been busy giving my often neglected <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking site</a> a much needed face lift, which at least I’ve been telling myself was what I needed to start posting more over there.  Lord knows I need to connect to food again.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I’m basically paralyzed by the utter lack of coverage by the “mainstream” media.  Seems the conservative powers that be have chiseled away at the “left leaning” place like CNN, where the recent announcements of Bill Bennett and, what’s his name, Glen Beck, have all but proven that the CNN is fighting to be the next FOX.
Look for a new look here at Mindless Ramblings next, with an emphasis on bringing in more content, and maybe slightly more emphasis on sharing the web design articles I find around the net.  Not to say I don’t need to get back on the hammer trail.  I’d also like to focus on Florida politics a little more, with the upcoming elections having great importance to all of us.</p>
