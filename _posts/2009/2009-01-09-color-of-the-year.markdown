PANTONE&reg; 14-0848 Mimosa, a "warm, engaging yellowâ€¦no other color expresses hope and reassurance more than yellow".  Interestingly enough, COLOURlovers has relatively few palettes <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/search?hsv=&sortType=ts&sortBy=desc&query=mimosa&hex=&lover=&hueOption0=&hueOption1=&hueOption2=&publishedBeginDate=12%2F27%2F2004&publishedEndDate=01%2F09%2F2009&x=29&y=7">tagged mimosa</a>, and of those few are inspiring.

I'll admit color and color theory aren't my strong suit, I tend to rely on Color Schemer Studio and sites like COLOURlovers.  I did put together this palatte based on mimosa.
