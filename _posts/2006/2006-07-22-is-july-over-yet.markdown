What a horrible month it's been.  I'm finally set up in my new digs with my internet and a environment that I feel comfortable enough to start truly moving forward, no matter how small the baby steps are.  
The worst of it all is a dear man, a troubled genius, someone whom I was honored to call my friend, took his life this week.  I'm not too comfortable with talking about it yet, perhaps at some point I'll blog a little more.  I'll just say that the world took a shot to the kidneys this past Monday evening when my friend Mike O'neill took his life.
<a href="http://tinylittledots.com/wordpress/?p=725">Tiny Little Dots</a> has already posted a little more about it, so I'll leave it to his site to fashion out the extended links.

I mourn losing Miguel, and I mourn for those who held him even closer than I.  May the next part of the journey bring more solace than the last.
