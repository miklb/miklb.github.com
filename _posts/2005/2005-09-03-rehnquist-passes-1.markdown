As if our country doesn't have enough on its plate, it is being reported Chief Justice Rehnquist died today.  So we are still arguing the merits of Roberts (to no avail), and now the discussion of which ultra-right wing judge will move up to replace Scalia, as he moves to Chief Justice.  Unless Bush pulls the PR move and names Sandra Day O'Conner, he has found the perfect distraction from his debacle in the delta.
