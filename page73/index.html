                  So the ‘net is abuzz that the hot tagging service del.icio.us was bought by yahoo.  Read through the comments, some are skeptical, some simply full of congrats, some outright damning the merger.  Me, eh, I’ll wait to see what happens, but will start trying to get <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/">scuttle</a>    working again, just in case.  I’ve been using <a href="http://www.blinklist.com">Blinklist</a> as well, and there’s no shortage of options out there, if yahoo does get too hands on.  I really don’t see it as this commenter &lt;blockquote&gt;What happened to the decentralization the internet was supposed to be so good for?&lt;/blockquote&gt;because, as I’ve said, there are other options out there, and will continue to grow, especially after this buy-out.</p>

                  I’d like to know a little more about the “efforts” of the DoD to connect soldiers with their citizenship.  While I commend the 79% that did their civic duty, and perhaps will make it a habit after they leave the military, I doubt the sincerity of the DoD’s reasons.  You had to be living in a cave in Afganhistan, (oops, no, they knew about it too) to not know about the slim margin Bush “won” by in ‘00, and the discussions of the military often voting Republican, etc, etc, etc.  So Rummy made a concerted effort to “get out the vote” as soon as the war started, hoping that the patriotism and general tendacies would help him keep his job for 4 more years.  Now that his job is not on the line, and the undertone of the politcal landscape is in much darker, I wonder if the DoD will make such a push for election turnout.  And more so, I wonder if the Dems can pressure the DoD to maintain the “program”, and turn the knife, so to speak, on the administration.</p>

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>So while doing a design for someone, I came across this site - <a href="http://www.blogbox.com/linkblox.php">Linkblox</a>.   Among some other flash type widgets, this one presents your links in a compact widget, especially if you have them categorized.  What’s nifty about this free widget, is that is uses OPML.  While not that familiar with it, a quick poke around the <a href="http://support.wordpress.org">forums</a>, I discovered that the links manager built into WordPress already outputs your links in an OPML file.  It’s found in your root WP folder at wp-links-opml.php.   The linkblox site simply asks for you to point to a OPML file, your URL, and then outputs a script  for you to place in your header and sidebar.  One for the header, one for the place you want your widget.  So what’s nice, is you can continue to use your “link this” bookmarklet, and keep your blogroll/links in your DB, so if the “linkblox” site disappears, or you decide to stop using it, you still have all your blogroll safely at your site.  The advanced customization for the widget gives you quite a bit of color customization, and the site promises this is a work in progress, which is why they are hosting the script, so that can make upgrades seamlessly behind the scenes.</p>
