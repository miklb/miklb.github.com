A lot of this site is based on that concept, and it’s something I’m learning more about.  The second, and more recent is from Design Melt Down, part of their “Beautiful Blogs” section.I did put a lot of time into this past springs CSSReboot for the site, and have tried to maintain the site despite the lapses in content.  However I would have never expected ANY type of recognition for the work.  So to the operators of the site, and those that have clicked over, thanks." />
