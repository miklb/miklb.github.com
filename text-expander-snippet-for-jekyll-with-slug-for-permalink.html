<meta name="description" content="There are plenty of TextExpander snippets floating around for creating Jekyll Front Matter, however, I wanted to take it a step further, and auto-create a slugified permalink with no additional work. The other part of the equation was that I wanted it to be able to use it on TE touch, which meant it had to be done in javascript. After a little Googling, some trial and error, I came up with one that takes a text input for the post title, generates a slug from that, and includes the current date. I understand that the date in the file can be used, however I may not always publish when the file was initially created.

      Wrote a @TextExpander snippet for @jekyllrb that generates Front Matter from Title, including a slugified permalink https://gist.github.com/miklb/53a93032fb8cc669b1fa
    </p>
      <p>There are plenty of TextExpander snippets floating around for creating Jekyll Front Matter, however, I wanted to take it a step further, and auto-create a slugified permalink with no additional work. The other part of the equation was that I wanted it to be able to use it on TE touch, which meant it had to be done in javascript. After a little Googling, some trial and error, I came up with one that takes a text input for the post title, generates a slug from that, and includes the current date. I understand that the date in the file can be used, however I may not always publish when the file was initially created. Not to mention, when I imported all of my posts from Habari, I needed to be able to use the original post date, not the date the file was created, so I continue to use that. You can certainly modify the snippet for your needs.</p>

<p>Also note, I have a blank variable for <em>summary</em>. Since I’m using webmentions, I use the summary as the text for a tweet, which would be different than an excerpt. Some of this may change when I redo the site redesign, but for now, it’s how I roll.</p>

<p>I would love feedback on how to make the snippet better as it’s my first javascript snippet. Just leave a comment on the gist.</p>

<noscript><pre>var title = &#39;%filltext:name=Title%&#39;;
slug = title.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, &#39;&#39;);
var newslug = title.split(&quot; &quot;).join(&quot;-&quot;);

var dt = new Date();

TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;---\n&quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;layout: post \n&quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;title: &quot; + &#39;&quot;&#39; +title + &#39;&quot;&#39;+ &quot;\n&quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;tags: \n&quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;published: true \n&quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;permalink: &quot;) +TextExpander.appendOutput(newslug.toLowerCase()); + TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot; \n&quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;date: &quot;) + TextExpander.appendOutput(dt.getFullYear() + &quot;-&quot; +(dt.getMonth() +1) + &quot;-&quot; + dt.getDate()) + TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;\n&quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;summary: \n&quot;);
TextExpander.appendOutput(&quot;--- \n&quot;);
