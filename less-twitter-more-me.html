  <h1 class="post-title p-name">Less Twitter, More Me</h1>
  <time datetime="2010-11-09T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">09 Nov 2010</time>
  <div class="e-content">
    <p class="lede p-bridgy-twitter-content">{page.summary}</p>
      <p>The first blog post I read about<a href="http://leoville.com/buzz-kill"> moving away from Twitter &amp; microblogging</a> began my thinking of how I might do the same.  I came into the “blogging culture” late in the game, so I didn’t have as much an identity as some.</p>

<p>However, lately I’ve been feeling more and more my <em>microblogging</em> platform of choice, Twitter, was becoming increasingly ephemeral.  I was conditioning myself to minimize my thoughts due to some arbitrary constraint.  Not to mention, I didn’t have my own reference point.  Sure, I use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">
Instapaper</a> &amp; <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, but I did not have a chronological reference to what I was thinking and feeling. Not to mention a real reference point of meaningful information I felt important to file away for posterity.</p>

<p>So today launches a new direction for Michael B, one where I do not question if I can get my point across in a finite set of characters, if my use of UTF-8 character encoding will translate to other platforms.  Where I can come back a year later and the data will be mine, easily reached, in a database of my own management.  No worries if I post a picture if someone will sell it, if my words will be broadcast to ears to which I’ll never know.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to say I will not be verbose (which I am) or that I’ve mastered some modern day <cite>Strunk &amp; White</cite>, rather I will not feel confined. And to which I will feel free.</p>

<p>Also, I will genuinely get back to the root of why I fell in love with publishing on the web, and hopefully make some, albeit small, mark on the face of web publishing.</p>

<p>This is just but the first iteration of the new site. I hope to integrate some of the third-party services that I previously shared on this domain, and still feel an important way of expressing fully who I am, but I needed to make the move now, and fill in the important pieces as I move forward once again.</p>

<p>I’m quite happy this is <strike>(not valid due to old content)</strike> HTML 5 with generous dashes of CSS 3. I hope to expand on both and as I learned my first go around with self-publishing on the web - learning is doing. (<em>Update: I was going to switch the videos to the experimental Youtube HTML5 embed code, however unfortunately the videos had been taken down. I also found additional typos in the same post. The home page is now currently valid HTML5</em>)</p>
