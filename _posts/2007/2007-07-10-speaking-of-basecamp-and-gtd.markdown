My previous post mentions BaseCamp and GTD, what I'd really, really, (no, really) like is a way to export my todo's from BaseCamp.  Most specifically, to the new Omni Focus, or even better, iCal, which then could be exported to some other format, be it Google Calendar, which supports Remember the Milk, or, as I mentioned, Omni Focus. (Which reminds me, I haven't been using it as much as I'd like, due to the the subject of this post).  Perhaps if my new system works out, I can use the quick add from Mail.app to OF as part of the system...hmm, might just work.
