        <p>I think with the help of a google search and <a href="http://blog.gruby.com/2007/12/14/bluetooth-in-vmware-fusion/">Scott Gruby</a>, I’ve figured out how to use my bluetooth keyboard in VM.</p>
<blockquote>Finally, I found a reference to inserting the Leopard DVD while in Windows. I tried this and when I did, the BootCamp driver installer came up and installed my drivers. Perfect; why couldn’t VMWare say something about this on their website?</blockquote>

<p>Thanks Scott and I agree, why isn’t this documented somewhere.</p>

<p><em>Edit 8/1/08</em>Seems you also have to disconnect the USB Bluetooth Host Controller to get it to work.  Something about only one OS can control the device at a time, so the machine gets confused when the two are both connected.  Disconnecting the controller, shutting down the XP install, then restarting VMware Fusion finally got it working.</p>

    <div class="e-content">
        <p>I’ve been quite lazy (or busy, you decide) lately, and have been meaning to update the 3 themes I’ve released to work with the latest trunk.  Previously, I kept decent todos and a svn repo for mzingi, but this time I simply bore down in some late night frenzy and got everything up-to-date.  I’ve got a new svn repo to work with, and will check them in at some point in the next few days, and hopefully will be able to better outline any changes.</p>

<p>Basically the changes to mzingi were minor, just a few code changes for things like atom links, and updating the YUI fonts and style sheet.  I also added some styling for draft posts.</p>

<p>As far as swanky and Harvest Field, they have more extensive changes, most evident in the sidebar content.  Harvest Field now only uses built in code for the footer content – the about, recent comments and more posts links.  The sidebar in Harvest Field is entirely plugin reliant now, sans the search and subscribe link.  It supports by default the Twitter, linkoid (for aside like posts - which is also excluded from the more posts offset) and the very nifty blogroll plugin.  All three have their own templates in the theme.  I also added support for the credits due plugin, with a built in page template, and conditional code in the footer.  Also, I <em>borrowed</em> the watermark for draft posts from <a href="http://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/connections">michaeltwofish’s connections theme</a>, and a little more emphasis on comments in moderation styling.</p>

<p>Swanky was also updated to use the current Twitter plugin/template, as well as added support for the blogroll plugin.  If these plugins are not active, nothing will show, nothing will break.  Recommended plugins are listed on the themes page.  As with Harvest Field, the draft watermark and comments in moderation were addressed.</p>

<p>As usual, if you find a bug, or would like to see something added/need help, please leave a comment either on this post or the original post for the theme in question.</p>

<p>So without further ado :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://miklb.com/swanky-theme">swanky</a></li>
<li><a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi">mzingi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://miklb.com/harvest-field-a-new-habari-theme">Harvest Field</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I’m putting the finishing touches on a demo site, which I’ll be adding links to the aforementioned theme posts.  Just need to decide how I want to add the theme switcher code (I’m trying to decide between adding a new fixed element at the top of each theme, or simply adding the dropdown to each sidebar).</p>

<p>As always, much thanks go to the community for the help and assistance in putting these together.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em> Twitter, linkoid, blogroll, and credit due plugins can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.habariproject.org/dist/plugins/">Habari extras</a></p>

<p><em><strong>Second Edit</strong></em> To clarify the “Credits” <em>feature</em> is accomplished by 1)activating the creditsdue plugin from extras 2)create a page with the slug “credits”, you can add additional content to the page if you want 3) there is no three (I’ve always wanted to say that!).</p>

        <p>What an experience this has been.  I hope to write a comprehensive post at some point about the experience, but suffice to say, it’s been quite the crash course on Apache, Debian, and DNS.</p>

<p>It all started with some curiosity, in which I purchased a <a href="http://slicehost.com">Slice</a>, and began poking around with the many tutorials they offer.  Ultimately, <a href="http://asymptomatic.net/">Owen</a> provided me with his LAMPME script that did the basic setup for a debain, apache2, PHP 5, MySQL 5 set up, using mod_vhost (please don’t quote me on any of this :-D ), which sorta got me going.  I got a bit sidetracked, and confused with setting up phpMyAdmin (I’m not that comfortable with CLI yet), and let the whole thing just sit, unused for a month or so.  However, due to the persistent <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/gs-grid-service-intermittent-service-availability/">problems with MediaTemple</a> grid-servers, I vowed to stop shelling out money to them for the hassles.  If my sites go down, I want to be the one to blame, and no one else.  Besides, it’s high time that I learn more about this aspect of web development.<br /><br />So, armed with help from<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><a href="http://skippy.net">Skippy</a>, and some new found confidence, I got everything set up so as to have a basic understanding of how/where things go, and started moving domains.  I’m just about done, with this being one of the last.  If anyone notices anything wonky, assuming I have visitors, please let me know.<br /><br />Also which is quite cool so far, is that I’m going to deploy the <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Multisite">multi-site</a> functionality of Habari to minimize the number of actual installs I have on the server, as I run everything off of head, this means less outdated installs.  Right now I’m looking at having just 2 actual installations, with everything else running off of those.  So far it’s worked out fine, though it took a little playing to get paths for things like images and files sorted out.  More on that later.  Certainly something that needs more attention, especially as silos mature.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who’ve helped in the process.<br /></p>

        <p>I just got off the phone with Verizon customer <s>migraine</s> service, and am left completely mystified.  My story starts with the fact that Verizon didn’t notify us that their was a shortage of HD DVR boxes when we placed our order.  It continued to the installation process, where the affable technician, albeit sporting the classic plumber’s crack while installing, failed to explain to us that while he was connecting the DVR to the HD TV, that in fact, we wouldn’t be able to watch any HD programming.  I had to wait until the next business day to speak to anyone about the problem (installation was on a Saturday, and though they advertise 24/7 support, that doesn’t apply to most FIOS issues).  I was then explained to that there was a back order on the Motorola HD DVR boxes, and that it would probably be the end of the month (February) before they were in.  Sounded fair.  They would discount our account the price of the DVR until then, we’d get the new DVR via UPS, swap them out, mail back the standard box at no cost.  OK, slightly inconveniencing, but fair.</p>

<p>First of March, I hadn’t heard anything, so I called customer service again.  I was given the same basic information, but this time, I was told middle of March.  Frustration is growing.</p>

<p>Mid March, I call again, I’d really like to be watching some of the movies and programming I enjoy in HD.  This time, I was told it would be the end of the month, and that some boxes had already been swapped out, but there was still a back order.  Frustration is reaching the point of wanting to yell and reach through the phone and choke the people on the other end of the line, but I managed to remain calm.</p>

<p>Which brings me to today.  I call to ask about this issue, as well as to inquire about picture-in-picture.  I get a tech support person who I’m sure isn’t based in the U.S., perhaps Mexico City?  Regardless, I inquire about the PIP.  This gentleman insists that if my TV supports PIP, then I should have PIP.  I explain to him that sure, with an antenna, I can watch PIP, but that PIP with the cable would require the box to split the signal, and when would this be introduced.  He doesn’t have a clue to what I’m talking about.  I ask to speak to someone else.</p>

<p>The next gentleman I speak with is most likely Indian, again, the primary problem is communication, not nationality for me.  This person informs me that if I want PIP, I would need a second box, or use a splitter from the coax entering the house and would get PIP for the first 50 channels.  Again, I try to explain that for instance, BrightHouse supports PIP within their DVR boxes, but he doesn’t believe me.  After another tech question about using the “last” (previous) button.  The Verizon Fios boxes support 9999 channels, so if you want to watch, say channel 8, you can just enter 8, but there’s a delay, so I got into the habit of hitting 0008.  Well, to me it’s a bug, to them, I’m stupid, but if you type 0008, then 0084, the previous/last button won’t work.  If I do 8/84 it works.  What ever.  I then asked to be transferred to customer service, as tech support doesn’t know anything about FIOS DVR boxes.  Oh, and he comes back and says, “they are working on the PIP as we speak, and might be available in 6 months”, obviously someone was listening in and corrected him to a degree.</p>

<p>I get a very nice lady, most likely U.S. based.  She tells me she’s not been given any timeframes for the the swap out, and that she’s been collecting names to call back when she has information.  At this point, I’m completely frustrated, and want to just cancel the package, without penalty (technically, we signed a 2 year contract, with a $199 cancellation fee) because they are not providing all the services outlined in the contract.  I was transferred to a “retention specialist”, again, most likely American, who said she didn’t know anything about PIP, nor did she have any time frames for when the boxes would be swapped.  I said I’d like to confirm I could cancel without penalty, and she said, no, you are still be provided with the bundled service.  I then outlined that I had been lied to about the time frame of replacement during the first month when I could have cancelled the service.  She simply ignored me.  Had I been told in mid February that it might 4 months before HD boxes would be available, I might not have signed on with Verizon at the time.  I could have gotten BrightHouse, without a contract, and simply switched when HD was available.  But no, Verizon felt is was better to lie and hide information and con us into keeping the contract for a short term gain, and the loss of long term satisfaction.</p>

<p>I will say I have no qualms with the other two services provided, internet connection is as fast as advertised,  and the phone service is fine.  I don’t like the fact that to use the provided voice mail, I have to call a separate number to check my voice mail, I can’t simply call my own number to do so, but what ever, that’s what the memory is for on the phone I suppose.</p>

<p>I’d love to know just for personal satisfaction if indeed Verizon could be sued for their unscrupulous actions regarding the hiding/lying about HD service.  I highly doubt I would have much of a case, as I don’t have any real documentation as to who/when I spoke with about the time frames, which I generally tend to do, and will start doing again when speaking with customer service reps.</p>

<p><em>Ahh, now I feel better.</em></p>
