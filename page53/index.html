                <p>So I’ve got an old truck.  And it was bloody hot out today.  Running errands, I see the temperature gauge creeping up.  Ok, needs water.  Not a big deal.  Yeah, right.  Sometime along the way, gas stations simply stopped offering water.  I can shampoo the hell out of my rug, but I can’t put the third most important thing in the thing to keep it running.  Not just one I tell you, ALL of them.<br />
                  I take that back, Shell had some water.  $.75 to use, and it came out by the thimble full.  At $2.80+ a gallon for gas, and record profits for these companies, you’d think that when they sell you water, you’d get enough to keep the vehicle running long enough to fill the tank back up.
Self preservation, or something.  Then again, I doubt they really care about those who aren’t driving around a brand new Escalade…</p>

Felt good.</p>

                <p>So I downloaded the bleeding edge version of Firefox, code name bon echo, to poke around a bit.  Seemed a little snappier, but could have been because 98% of the plugins were disabled.  Turn it off, open my regular firefox, and without asking me, it upgraded to 1.5.0.3.  Bullshit, I say.  I don’t want the latest version, if simply for the fact that the reason I use FireFox is the extensions.  And this version, the extensions I rely on, are now disabled.  So I might as well use Safari.  I like to wait until the extensions catch up with the release.  And I’m not at all happy with the new RSS icon in the address bar.  This really was a bad move, and I’m not sure how it happened.  A really bad taste, that’s for sure.</p>
                <p><strong>Update</strong> So I’m guessing they realized that 1.5.0.3 was borked, because 1.5.0.4 is now out, and my extensions work now.  In the meantime, I checked out <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>, a Mac mozilla based browser, and may just well use that for everyday browsing.  I don’t like the idea of using more than one, but now that I have <a href="http://miklb.com/scuttle/">Scuttle</a> set up on my site, (I used delicious, but don’t like the idea of Yahoo controlling my bookmarks), bookmarking isn’t as big an issue with the 2 browser set up.  Camino is faster, FF offers extensions that make working on web sites invaluable.  So I may just become a 2 broswer guy.</p>
