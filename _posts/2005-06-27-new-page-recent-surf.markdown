So a while back, I found the on line "community bookmark manager", delicious.  Basically any site you find, you could bookmark to delicious, as you would with your browser, however the advantage is that if you were away from your computer, you could still access your bookmarks.  Also, it employs the use of "tags", that is, a description of the bookmark.  Using that concept, you could find other sites that relate to the "tag".  It's a good idea, and anyone can check it out, but I was turned onto a script , Scuttle, that allows an individual or group of individuals to create their own "community bookmark manager".<!--more-->I created a <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blog/recent-surf">page</a> that gives a RSS feed of the 15 most current, but I'm thinking about changing that to a random list.  If anyone else would be interested in "joining" my bookmark manager, drop me a line, either via a comment, or the contact page.  I am toying with the idea of changing its CSS to look more like this site, and simply allow anyone to look through the bookmarks.  But it's definitely just a project, with no real time table.  Again, if you're interested, let me know.
