summary: "The advice I like to give…is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work."

Tina Roth Eisenberg often has great quotes on her blog, SwissMiss. Catching up on my feeds this past week, she shared a quote ["Get to Work"](http://www.swiss-miss.com/2016/07/get-to-work-2.html) that struck a nerve as I've been guilty of *waiting for inspiration* all week.

<blockquote>
The advice I like to give young artists, or really anybody who’ll listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work.

If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to do an awful lot of work. All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself.
