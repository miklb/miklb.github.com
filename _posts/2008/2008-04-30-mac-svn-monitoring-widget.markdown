<a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2008/04/svn_notifier.php">SVN Notifiier</a> is a handy little Mac Dashboard widget that, using Growl, will notify you when a local working copy is out of date.  I've not quite gotten the "sticky" notice to work, but I just might need to edit the actual Growl settings.

Still, it's nice to be able at a glance check your dashboard, or see a little growl notice pop up.
