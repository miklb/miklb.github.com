    <title>WordPress Blank Theme V2beta - Miklb’s Mindless Ramblings</title>
    <meta property="og:title" content="WordPress Blank Theme V2beta" />
    <meta name="description" content="While I’m in a blogging flurry, I figured I’d go ahead and share my newest “blank theme”.  I do quite a bit of WP work, either converting open source designs, modifying existing site’s design to a WP theme, or custom work, and often have the use for a framework to start.  For the past couple of years, I’ve been using my popular Blank Theme, but more and more, I’ve found the markup not to my liking, and as it’s based on Kubrick, a bit outdated code wise.  So I’ve cooked up a blank theme from scratch, using much more (hopefully) semantic markup, and a much more streamlined framework.  This version currently only has an index, header, footer, sidebar (as an unordered list, which should be widget ready, though I would need to add a function.php file.  It also includes a bit of code handy for recent posts), single post, and page template.  I also am using Christian Montoya’s comment template instead of Kubricks.  I hopefully covered all the elements in the templates in the style sheet, as well as have a few basic global elements set." />

          <p>While I’m in a blogging flurry, I figured I’d go ahead and share my newest “blank theme”.  I do quite a bit of WP work, either converting open source designs, modifying existing site’s design to a WP theme, or custom work, and often have the use for a framework to start.  For the past couple of years, I’ve been using my popular <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/my-site/blank-wordpress-theme/">Blank Theme</a>, but more and more, I’ve found the markup not to my liking, and as it’s based on Kubrick, a bit outdated code wise.  So I’ve cooked up a blank theme from scratch, using much more (hopefully) semantic markup, and a much more streamlined framework.  This version currently only has an index, header, footer, sidebar (as an unordered list, which <em>should</em> be widget ready, though I would need to add a function.php file.  It also includes a bit of code handy for recent posts), single post, and page template.  I also am using <a href="http://www.christianmontoya.com/2006/10/15/full-featured-commentsphp-template-for-wordpress/">Christian Montoya’s comment template</a> instead of Kubricks.  I hopefully covered all the elements in the templates in the style sheet, as well as have a few basic global elements set.</p>
          <p>Remember, this is a <strong>blank theme.  It is completely unstyled, and is meant as a framework in which to customize a theme</strong>.  Also, this is meant for WP &gt;= 2.1.x, as it uses several new template tags.</p>
          <p><strong>Update:  Download link fixed. (damn typos)</strong></p>
          <p>You can download the <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blankv2beta.zip">Blank Theme v2 beta</a>.</p>
          <p>I would appreciate any and all feed back, both for missing elements, and suggestions for additions.</p>
