A last minute entry into <a href="http://www,freemacware.com">freemacware.com's</a> contest, listing your 5 most favored freeware apps.  Their list is quite extensive, and I've found several apps I didn't know about, but for the most part, these are the ones I use day in and day out. (I can't say these are in any particular order)
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/cyberduck">Cyberduck</a> - a super great FTP client, that works hand in hand with several text editors and CSS Edit to allow editing files directly on the server</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/smultron">Smultron</a> - my text editor of choice.  As noted, it works flawlessly with Cyberduck</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/growl">Growl</a> - A sytem wide notification app, that works with numerous apps, including cyberduck to notify you when a file's been up/down loaded, in itunes when a new song plays, can set up a gmail or mail notifier, and numerous other apps all with an unobtrusive faded in box in the upper right corner</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/adium">Adium</a> - my IM app of choice.  I don't do IM with a lot of different people, however, I do a lot of work with people all of the world, so having AOL, yahoo and gtalk all in the same app makes it quite easy to connect with a client in their IM of choice</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freemacware.com/voodoopad-lite">VooDoo Pad lite</a> - A fantastic note app, that works like a little wiki right on your desktop.  I really love how I can make a table of contents type page, and then create "links" to new pages.  I can really simply, and quickly organize a project this way.  Also supports drag and drop functionality too, so I can drag an image to a page, a link generally anything.  I've seriously thought about purchasing the "pro" version, or what ever they call it, simply because I use the app so much.</li>
</ol>
Some other apps I use/recommend are obviously <a href="http://www.freemacware.com/firefox">firefox</a>, as well as<a href="http://www.freemacware.com/vienna"> vienna</a> and <a href="http://www.freemacware.com/flickrexport">flickr export</a> an iphoto plugin that allows quick and easy sharing of your photos via <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a>.

If I've missed a great app, I'd love to know about it.
