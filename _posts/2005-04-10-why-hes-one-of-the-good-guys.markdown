<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/04/10/congress_should_revisit_issues_of_schiavo_case/">Boston Globe / Op-ed / Congress should revisit issues of Schiavo case</a>  Though I feel Congressman Davis has done a sufficient job as my representative, and for the time support his bid for Governor, each time I see or hear Congressman Frank speak, I yearn for someone with a similar voice to stand up and lead within my state.
<blockquote>THE FACT that Congress adopted a bad law in the Terri Schiavo case -- unwise, unprincipled, and unconstitutional -- does not mean Congress must never again return to the subject. It is too early to adopt any legislation, but it is appropriate for Congress to begin discussing what public policy ought to be with regard to the anguishing issues in this case...They mandated federal preemption of decisions resulting in the end of life but said nothing about situations in which state authorities might block individual decisions to allow death to occur in accordance with the wishes of the affected individual. In the current climate, it is this latter right that may well be in the greater jeopardy.</blockquote>
