    <title>FireFox 2 A Web Developers Friend - Miklb’s Mindless Ramblings</title>
    <meta property="og:title" content="FireFox 2 A Web Developers Friend" />
    <meta name="description" content="I’ve blogged about my browser issues before, but I just have to share how cool I think FireFox 2 is.  Now with built in spell checker (just right click a word, and suggestions are at the top of the menu, perfect for blogging and email), it’s quick, totally extensible , and just makes working on line so much more productive.  A few extensions are a must for me, so I had to wait a few weeks for them to be released before I could start testing it, but the wait was well worth it.First was the GrApple theme.  I loathe the candy-ish default theme, and was quite pleased when theme makers started adding Mac Os-esque brushed metal themes.  I haven’t taken to the newer Apple look, ie, iTunes 7, so the more subtle brushed metal look of GrApple suites me fine, especially the small buttons in the nav bar.Then are the extensions.Some plugins were FF 2.0 ready, such as the indispensable Web Developer.  I’m a big fan of using tabs, and one extension was borking my tabs.  Uninstalling the Tabbed Browser Preferences solved the issues.  A better tab manager, Tab Mix Plus,  fixes issues with windows opening up instead of tabs (note, I downloaded a RC from the developer site, the new release should up on mozilla in the next day or so).Another great developer tool is MeasureIt, which allows you drag across the screen a box that measures in pixels.  When working out kinks in spacing, this is invaluable.  Also helpful is ViewSourceWith, which lets you choose an application (like a text editor) to open a page source with.  Makes finding which line number an error is a snap.  Finally, Colorzilla allows you to grab hex colors from a site, nice to have if you are trying to recreate an existing site, or simply like a color scheme of a site.A few other extensions that I recently discovered are CSSViewer, which once turned on, allows you scroll around a page, and it shows the CSS for that element, and OPML Support, which allows you to import/export your FF bookmarks in an OPML format, which for WordPress users, is nice, as you can import those files into your Blogroll/Links Manager, not to mention RSS reader.In addition to those, Google’s Browser sync and toolbar, CoComment’s extension and AdBlock Plus, make general browsing a snap.There are literally thousands of extensions out there, with new ones being added all the time.  If you’ve discovered any other can’t-live-without extensions, I’d love to hear about them." />

Now with built in spell checker (just right click a word, and suggestions are at the top of the menu, perfect for blogging and email), it’s quick, totally extensible , and just makes working on line so much more productive.  A few extensions are a must for me, so I had to wait a few weeks for them to be released before I could start testing it, but the wait was well worth it.<br />
            First was the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1322/">GrApple</a> theme.  I loathe the candy-ish default theme, and was quite pleased when theme makers started adding Mac Os-esque brushed metal themes.  I haven’t taken to the newer Apple look, ie, iTunes 7, so the more subtle brushed metal look of GrApple suites me fine, especially the small buttons in the nav bar.
Then are the extensions.
Some plugins were FF 2.0 ready, such as the indispensable <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/">Web Developer</a>.  I’m a big fan of using tabs, and one extension was borking my tabs.  Uninstalling the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/158/">Tabbed Browser Preferences</a> solved the issues.  A better tab manager, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1122/">Tab Mix Plus</a>,  fixes issues with windows opening up instead of tabs (note, I downloaded a RC from the developer site, the new release should up on mozilla in the next day or so).
Another great developer tool is <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/539/">MeasureIt</a>, which allows you drag across the screen a box that measures in pixels.  When working out kinks in spacing, this is invaluable.  Also helpful is <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/394/">ViewSourceWith</a>, which lets you choose an application (like a text editor) to open a page source with.  Makes finding which line number an error is a snap.  Finally, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/271/">Colorzilla</a> allows you to grab hex colors from a site, nice to have if you are trying to recreate an existing site, or simply like a color scheme of a site.
A few other extensions that I recently discovered are <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2104/">CSSViewer</a>, which once turned on, allows you scroll around a page, and it shows the CSS for that element, and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2625/">OPML Support</a>, which allows you to import/export your FF bookmarks in an OPML format, which for WordPress users, is nice, as you can import those files into your Blogroll/Links Manager, not to mention RSS reader.
In addition to those, Google’s Browser sync and toolbar, <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/tools/extension">CoComment’s extension</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1865/">AdBlock Plus</a>, make general browsing a snap.
There are literally thousands of extensions out there, with new ones being added all the time.  If you’ve discovered any other can’t-live-without extensions, I’d love to hear about them.</p>
