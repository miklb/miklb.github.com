Ah, your alma matre isn’t going to the Rose Bowl this year, so it’s time to cry fowl. Boo hoo!  Try fixing the education system, or working on getting better funding for students, rather than this.  Any thing, heck, I’d rather here some discussion about giving student athletes a stipend than how the BCS is flawed.  Sure it is, so was the old bowl system.  But this is that last place Congress needs to be sticking their nose.  With record deficits, a war, corruption all over the Republican map, and this is best they’ve got.  Flabergasted, that’s all I’ve got to say. I wonder if this guy Barton is one of the ones the Texas jerrymandering case got elected?" />
