As the <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at200524_model.html">computer models</a> have her slightly lower than the Tampa area, the most recent <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT4+shtml/190236.shtml">discussion</a> talks of some slightly different motion than previously forcast, and how the recent NOAA jet's flight data would have on the models.  Keep an eye out folks, it ain't over yet.
