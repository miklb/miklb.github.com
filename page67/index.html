<p>Now that he’s made more mainstream news cycles, I’ve refrained from posting much on the Hammer.  But I feel this news is worthy of a shout from the cliff, as it signals to me the pressure from within the party is doing exactly what I said they would do…use him up and throw him on hte scrap heap.  He will probably lose his primary in March, as I’d guess the republican machine will throw their money behind his competitor, hoping he’ll have a better chance against a democrat in the fall.  From there, he can be a fall guy for the Abramhoff deal, along with Ney, probably taking a bullet or two for several other republicans.  So this story is FAR from over, and the dominos have yet to get primary players, but one can only hope the truth <em>mostly</em> comes out.</p>

Hmmm.  Interesting rant.  Also curious as to why the author is using XHTML, <em>transitional</em>  Note, this site <em>used to</em>be valid, but as a user of the Alpha Squible theme, it currently isn’t.  That will change with either a switch to the impending beta, or a totally new design.</p>

    <p>Incase you missed it, Democrats and two Republicans, Mike DeWine and Lincoln Chafee, stood their ground, and managed to keep ANWR off the defense bill.  Pete Dominenici of New Mexico (?) has already vowed to add it to a filibuster proof budget bill in the spring, one I’m sure that will be full of all kinds of pork barrel projects.  So warm up that keyboard and start writing your represenatives, and voice your opinion, be it on ANWR, or the President spying on fellow Americans.</p>

<p>Arctic drilling on a defense bill.  If you’ve read here lately, you know my stance on that.  And now even some Republicans are calling Stevens and Frist out on playing politics with our national defense.  And poor ol’ Dick might have to cut his trip short to cast a vote.  Let’s hope that doesn’t happen, or he gets held up by a sandstorm.</p>
