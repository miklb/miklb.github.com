Luckily, a judge didn’t see it that way, and ruled that there was no evidence that the research from several years ago was reversed.
In a related note, a similar case was ruled on on the West Coast regarding a species of salamander, in which the administration tried to lump several species together so as to remove them from the endangered species list.<br />
One can only assimilate that the reason to remove these species is so development can infringe on the habitat of these endangered species.  I’d like to know a little more about what kind of development that would be.</p>

A farewell bang is set this evening for Hunter S Thompson’s remains.</p>

<p>Hope it’s a blast.  To have friends like that, he had to have been everything we think him to be.  I even forgive him for his pathetic bashing of the Bucs before the Superbowl.  But what better team than the Raiders, the perennial bad boys, for Thompson to be a fan of.</p>

        <p>So I have this personal blog, my <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking blog</a>, school starting, and going back to work full time in a kitchen a couple months from now, I’ve started <a href="http://miklb.mojomega.com/wordpress/">another blog</a>, this one specific to the WordPress community.  Plugin announcments, new themes, WP news in general.  It came about as I’m working with some developers who are beginning a hosting company, with some added features.
<!--more-->
  As most hosting services offer some sort of auto install of the many popular open-source free scripts available, most do not offer any support for those scripts.  This hosting service intends on being different.  They will offer built in support for installation and customization.  Being the WordPress fan that I am, I intend on working in that area, as well as being a liason with developers of other open-source scripts.  Another reason I have joined this development, is they intend to put their money where their mouth is, so to speak, and give back in the form of cold hard cash to the  development of the scripts.  The basic workings will be that a percentage of profit from any customization of a script will go back to that script.  So if you joined the host, and hired them to write a custom theme and install plugins for your WordPress install,  a percentage of that would go back to WordPress.  Not to mention, a link to each scripts donation box is given, so that end users can directly donate to the development of the scripts themselves, of they so feel inclined.  A vast difference from fantastico in cpanel with a huge disclaimer that no support is offered, and a link to the script’s web site.</p>

        &quot;Blank&quot; WordPress Theme

        <p><strong>I’m offering up an updated, beta version <a href="http://www.miklb.com/wordpress-blank-theme-v2beta/">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>So, as I’ve begun designing WordPress themes, I found the tutorial over at <a href="http://www.urbangiraffe.com/themes/guides">Urban Giraffe</a> invaluable.  They walk you through the dissection of the default Kubrick theme, how to strip it down to bare bones, and start with a blank style sheet.  Now that I’ve done that a couple of times, I decided it would be nice to have all the work done, and be able to have all the template files cleaned, as well as a style sheet with all the divs and classes there, simply without the style.
<!--more-->
 So rather than changing an existing sheet, it’s a blank canvass or sorts, but kinda like a paint by numbers as well.
Bear in mind, I may have missed a few elements, and if you discover one missing, please comment.  My goal is to have as thorough a starting point as possible.  Also note, numerous additional divs and classes can be added, this is simply a starting point, but covers as much of the basics as possible.
One last note, <strong>this is not a theme, it is a stripped down version of the default theme, which contains all the templates necessary, as well as a style sheet that is missing the style</strong>.  If you simply upload this “theme” and activate it, you will have zero styling, meaning no widths, no margins, no clearing.  So please do not comment that the theme didn’t work, or does not appear properly on your site.  This is solely meant for someone who wants to follow along with the tutorial, or who like me, wants some of the dirty work out of the way, and just wants to start styling a theme.</p>

<p>I’d love to see what people do with the Blank Theme, so please post a link to any new themes you design.</p>

<p>A final note, I eliminated the “narrowcolumn” and “widecolumn”, and wrapped everything in the div- wrapper, as Urban Giraffe did.  I found it was much easier to create a theme that works in all browsers and platforms by following that concept.</p>

<p>The Blank Theme can be downloaded &lt;here .</p>
