<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/21/AR2005062101632.html">The Washington Post</a>
So it seems that the lobbying industry has doubled in the years since Bush has been in office; anyone suprised?
Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/25/AR2005062500983.html">hearings regarding Kevin Ring and Jack Abramoff</a> continue on Capitol Hill.  When will middle America figure out they are being screwed?  When they can't afford their Viagra and fake tits anymore?
