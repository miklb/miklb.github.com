So I realize all they are really doing is searching Technorati for keywords. And though I know Technorati pulls categories as tags, a politics rant may not show up in a search about Tom DeLay.  Thus, I installed a tag generator for the site (via a WordPress plugin, Jerome’s keywords) so that I can start adding tags to my posts, and possibly get some hotty on CNN to read my post on air.
