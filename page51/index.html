              So a supervisor of elections uncovers more security issues with electronic voting machines, and our elected leader’s answer is to pass a bill preventing independent testing of the equipment.  Real bloody smart.  I’m all for technological advancements in all areas of government, but I also want to know that the technology is secure.  Which means testing, and more testing.  Rather than a knee jerk reaction and getting into bed with a company because of questionable lobbying practices, or the like.  I really hope this bill has limited support, and state reps shoot this down quickly.</p>

              Mark Cuban, blogger and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is blogging the NBA finals.  I have to say, his blogging has made it infectious to be a Mav’s fan for the finals.  I’m not really a basketball fan, but have a few friends who’ve been watching the playoffs, so I’ve followed along.  I also came across Mark Cuban’s blog while checking out some feeds while investigating over at <a href="http://share.opml.org">Share Your OPML</a> as the playoffs started.  So I’ve been following his blogs while keeping an eye to the playoffs.  It’s fun to see things transpire as they have.</p>

            <p>On the heels of 6.6.06, I find this little web site that calculates your estimated time of death based on a series of questions.  Not the cheery thing, but perhaps a little reality to snap us back into a healthier lifestyle is what we need.</p>

            <p><a href="http://9rules.com/blog/2006/06/round-4-whats-next/">9rules Network</a> has announced <strong>111</strong> new sites for the network.  <em>111!?</em>  Before I go any further, let me say, that I’m not some bitter blogger that was part of the 589 bloggers that were rejected.  I would never consider this blog something for a network.  I don’t have a niche, I don’t post enough, I simply rant out loud, and a few people actually read it.  Period. 
But as someone who reads a lot of sites, I once took a site’s acceptance into 9rules as some sort of validation, that perhaps before reading a post, there was a strong chance that the author was going to know what they were talking about, or that the information would indeed be valid.  But to water down the network, IMO, with that many blogs in one fell swoop, I can’t help but believe it was a publicity stunt for a group that had recently fallen off the radar, so to speak.<br />
              I mean, what better way to get the blogosphere to chatter about you than to “accept” 111 sites into the network.  How much traffic directly from those sites is generated alone?  Plus those, (I guess I’m buying into the hype by posting this) who comment on the recent events.  I must say, I really have a hard time buying any of this, and will now take the 9rules logo on a site with a grain of salt, and that is an injustice to those who have been longer termed members of the network.
I’d like to say I haven’t looked at all 111 sites, and I’m sure they are all fine bloggers in their own right.  I simply have a hard time understanding how that many are brought in at once.
I think I might create a snazzy little logo and start my own network.  I’m sure at least 100 of those 589 that were not admitted are as good in their own right as the 111 picked.  It could be called the Odd Man Out Network.  Wonder how much ad revenue that would generate?  Anyone interested in joining?</p>
