So while surfing the TV last night, I caught a bit of NBC's Law and Order:Criminal Intent.  Something about a couple of federal judges murdered.  Didn't stick around too long, but I wished I had.  It appears that one of the detectives, frustrated by the lack of clues, quipped something to the effect they should look for someone in a Tom Delay t-shirt.  An obvious knock at DeLay and his statements about "activist" judges and how they should be removed, and the uproar that ensued about judges' safety.
Anyway, DeLay's pissed, and spouting off about the characterization.  Get over yourself Tom.  Try spending some of that energy figuring out why you let a lobbyist pay for your round of golf at St Andrews, and how the democrats, with a serious minority in the Congress, are pulling the strings these days.
