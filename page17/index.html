  <div class="e-content">
    
      <p><img src="/user/images/CCB.png" class="right" alt="Cigar City Brewing" />A <a href="http://blog.cigarcitybeer.com/2010/11/10/255-the-tasting-room-needs-your-help-again.aspx">plea from Cigar City Brewing</a> came across my Twitter feed this morning via <a href="http://www.independenttampa.com/">The Independent - Tampa</a>.  This is a perfect example of why I am going to start using my blog more and not just Twitter. Sure, I could retweet the link, say 3-4 words on it, but I want to fully comment on the situation.</p>

<p>The nutshell, the Tampa City Council failed to make permanent the wet zoning license and extend the hours for the tasting room of Cigar City Brewing.  I’ve watched enough city council meetings to know this is generally a no brainer for a business like this that has had zero incidents.  But for those that don’t live in Tampa or not as familiar, the owner of the CCB’s father has some high profile businesses that have clashed with the city for years.  These city council members are punishing the son for issues they may have with the father.  I know this because I watched the original city council meeting when they went for their license and zoning originally.  They didn’t <em>trust</em> that this would be a legitimate business. Or at least those were the implications. That somehow this would all be a ruse to get some kind wet zoning and turn into some other type of business.</p>

<p>Little does the backwards uninformed who failed to vote on this know, but Cigar City Brewing is known nationally, internationally if you include Canada. Their beers are recognized and respected amongst some of the biggest and best micro-breweries.  Shutting down the tasting room, or at the least minimizing it’s ability to do business, is a travesty and yet another sign of how far Tampa really is behind the times.</p>

<p>So if you are a craft beer fan not in Tampa, perhaps follow one of the links from the CCB site and tell a council member about your support for the art and the quality of the beer from CCB. If you do live in the city limits, please tell Ms. Miller, Rev. Scott (who is running for mayor? really you’d not want a world class business like this to not succeed?) and Mr. Stokes (oh, on second thought I will run for city council after telling you I wouldn’t) that not supporting this permanent license is a travesty and a disservice to the city.</p>

  <div class="e-content">
    
      <p>The first blog post I read about<a href="http://leoville.com/buzz-kill"> moving away from Twitter &amp; microblogging</a> began my thinking of how I might do the same.  I came into the “blogging culture” late in the game, so I didn’t have as much an identity as some.</p>

<p>However, lately I’ve been feeling more and more my <em>microblogging</em> platform of choice, Twitter, was becoming increasingly ephemeral.  I was conditioning myself to minimize my thoughts due to some arbitrary constraint.  Not to mention, I didn’t have my own reference point.  Sure, I use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">
Instapaper</a> &amp; <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, but I did not have a chronological reference to what I was thinking and feeling. Not to mention a real reference point of meaningful information I felt important to file away for posterity.</p>

<p>So today launches a new direction for Michael B, one where I do not question if I can get my point across in a finite set of characters, if my use of UTF-8 character encoding will translate to other platforms.  Where I can come back a year later and the data will be mine, easily reached, in a database of my own management.  No worries if I post a picture if someone will sell it, if my words will be broadcast to ears to which I’ll never know.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to say I will not be verbose (which I am) or that I’ve mastered some modern day <cite>Strunk &amp; White</cite>, rather I will not feel confined. And to which I will feel free.</p>

<p>Also, I will genuinely get back to the root of why I fell in love with publishing on the web, and hopefully make some, albeit small, mark on the face of web publishing.</p>

<p>This is just but the first iteration of the new site. I hope to integrate some of the third-party services that I previously shared on this domain, and still feel an important way of expressing fully who I am, but I needed to make the move now, and fill in the important pieces as I move forward once again.</p>

<p>I’m quite happy this is <strike>(not valid due to old content)</strike> HTML 5 with generous dashes of CSS 3. I hope to expand on both and as I learned my first go around with self-publishing on the web - learning is doing. (<em>Update: I was going to switch the videos to the experimental Youtube HTML5 embed code, however unfortunately the videos had been taken down. I also found additional typos in the same post. The home page is now currently valid HTML5</em>)</p>

  <div class="e-content">
    
      <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/riverspring/5028694522/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5028694522_b364c8b4d9.jpg" class="right" /></a>This past weekend was the 3rd <a href="http://barcamptampabay.org/">Barcamp Tampa Bay</a>. Afterwords, Peter Radizeski one of the original organizers tweeted <a href="http://twitter.com/radinfo/status/25640430439">“how do we keep the community talking between BarCamps?”</a>, to which my answer was that I believe the key is to foster the “mini” communities that come together at Barcamps, and that cross pollination amongst the smaller communities will keep the discussions going.  To which Peter replied he didn’t think the cross pollination was working.  I respect all of the work that Peter has done to help build Tampa Bay tech communities.  I think we move in slightly different “mini” communities, so perhaps there are some that don’t cross over as much as others, but I will say in the 2 years since BarCamp 2008, I genuinely believe that it is happening.  Perhaps not as fast as some would like, but it wasn’t that long ago that I didn’t know a single person in real life working with WordPress, web development or web technologies in the Tampa Bay area.</p>

<p>I was someone who had switched careers, was working from home freelancing, and all of my interaction was online.  I used to joke that I had more friends in the industry overseas than I did in the Bay area.  Now that is not the case.  Perhaps partly from the proliferation of services like Twitter, but I now know real live human beings living in the Bay area who work with similar technologies as myself.  That circle grows larger every time I attend a local event, be it Barcamp or more recently, the local <a href="http://tampabaywordpress.org/">WordPress User Group</a>.  I don’t get to <em>hang out</em> with these people as much as I’d like, but that’s the case with my friends not in the industry too.  Life just gets in the way.</p>

<p>I do think there is a responsibility for those who want to see a more thriving community locally to as I said, foster the smaller communities and try and bring the Barcamp sharing and nurturing mentality to their smaller circles.  Perhaps it’s time someone reaches out to Ryan and the <a href="http://floridacreatives.com/category/tags/tampa">Florida Creatives</a> to start an active, local chapter to help bring the smaller communities together.  Maybe there’s another umbrella organization that just hasn’t been started.  Are people put off by the term “creative”? I honestly don’t have the answer.  I know earlier this year myself and several others discussed what possible umbrella organization could help achieve this, and nothing came of it.  Maybe it’s time to revisit the conversation in a broader scope?  I was speaking with an organizer of BarCamp Sarasota and they do events year round under the BarCamp moniker.  Is BarCamp evolving from the DIY stick-it-to-the-man un-conference into a “brand” that people can associate with and can be that umbrella?  Again, I don’t claim to have all of the answers, but certainly would love to see the discussion continue, and will continue to make efforts in my smaller circles to build a local community of web technologist for the Tampa Bay area.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/4964990093"><img class="left" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/4964990093_6f51f336e8_m.jpg" /></a>I picked up a Canon SX-20 IS several months back, but due to a variety of reasons, I’d not really taken it out yet and started shooting pictures with it.  Nor have I done much digital photography using manual settings, so today I set out to remedy that.  I’m a complete novice when it comes to fully understanding aperture, shutter speed and ISO speeds, but I’m determined to learn.  So far the Canon SX-20 seems to be the perfect place to start.  With that said, this is by no means a <em>review</em> of the camera as I’m completely not qualified to comment on what is right or wrong with the camera.  I chose it based on feedback from a couple of amateur photographers whose knowledge of photography I respect.  They both had the SX-10, and based on the features and cost, the SX-20 seemed not to be too far from what the SX-10 offered.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/4965589398"><img class="right" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/4965589398_f2e3f5b490_m.jpg" /></a>Today I primarily tried to just get used to adjusting the f-stop and shutter speed to get a good balance.  I primarily stuck with 400 and 800 for ISO.  Having never used a digital camera to adjust these settings, it certainly seemed like a good starting point for getting familiar with the controls.  All and all, by the end of the walk along the board walk at Lettuce Lake Park, I was feeling fairly comfortable with the controls and adjusting the two settings.  I’m still getting familiar with finding objects in the viewer when trying to locate a specific object (like a certain flower or the Cuban Yellow Warbler).  Certainly something with practice I’m sure I’ll get the hang of.  I also need to pay more attention to my light source, but for having not picked up the camera in several months, I think  I got a few good picks, which is probably more of a testament of the camera than my abilities at this point.  I am however confident that this camera will be a great learning tool as well as have the ability to capture some nice images.  Now I can’t wait to read up a little more on balancing ISO with shutter speed and f-stop, as well as just get out and take more pictures.  Next time I’m thinking about a more urban setting like Ybor.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> These are completely untouched with any post processing. I really want to see the original image so as to compare as I continue to learn.

      <p>I was  a quasi punk teenager when I first traveled to Hyde Park to experience “art”.  Sure, I’d done the Ybor thing, but this was high end stuff as far as I had experienced it.  A live performance of actors was way more than seeing Black Flag do 3 songs then run off stage.  This was <em>School of Night</em>.  I honestly don’t remember the skits, but I do remember Jeff and another actor doing a scene from a Sam Shepard piece (<em> I think </em> it was from <cite>True West</cite>).</p>

<p>As I grew older, I took advantage of the opportunities to experience Jeff’s larger performances with troupes like  <a href="http://www.americanstage.org/">American Stage</a>.   During this time, I was introduced to Jeff through a mutual acquaintance.  He was humble, brooding.  Everything I had pictured an artist to be.  I was jealous.</p>

<p>I thought him an older but kindred spirit, not a celebrity.  He <strong>was</strong> an artist.  I got a glimpse of a genius.  Someone who was so comfortable with his art; perhaps tortured in the fact that he was such a craftsman of his art that he could perform it in a burgh such as Tampa.  He trusted that there were like minded souls who also parked their tent in this god-forsaken mosquito ridden peninsula of peninsulas a genuine art scene would evolve.  I know I cooked food with that same passion.  I regret I didn’t stay true to my own passion…</p>

<p>I for one apologize for being so shortsighted I didn’t realize it sooner–yes, I wanted a dynamic, brilliant local scene. And there is one. Theatre, food, dance… it’s all there.  Maybe not how I envisioned it because I wanted brilliance such as Jeff’s to be national news, and in my youth I lost my vision.</p>

<p>However, in the twilight of my own perspective, and in the sunset of the passing of Jeff Norton, I reflect on that first night in a little corner bistro at Howard and Azeele, and pray that the baton of pure passion and art will continued to be passed.</p>

<p>God speed Jeff Norton, god speed.</p>
