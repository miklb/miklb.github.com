              <div class="e-content">
                <p>I skipped Tunesday last week as I was in a bit of mourning finding out that morning that Langerado, a huge music festival planned for next month had just been canceled.  I had been really looking forward to 3 days of getting away, and just seeing live music.  One of the bands that was scheduled to play is one of my all time favorites, <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/Lucero-MP3-Download/11573841.html">Lucero</a>.</p>
                <p>I discovered Lucero via a jukebox.  One of those jukeboxes in a hip downtown bar: dark, smoky, someplace you can both go to hang with friends, or sit and drown your sorrows as you suffer a broken heart.  It was during one of those times of broken heartedness that I first heard them.  It was soon there after that they came through town, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
                <p>I was sitting at the bar, throwing back a few whiskeys, and struck up a conversation with a guy at the bar.  We wound up buying each other a shot, listening to the opening act.  As the first band ended, he got up, we exchanged a few pleasantries, and he proceeds to head towards the stage.  Damned if it wasn’t Ben, the lead singer.  They proceeded to play one of those sets that you just never forget, and set the stage for me not missing another opportunity to see them live.</p>
                <p>As with a lot of music I listen to, they have that Alt-Country/Americana edge, think&lt;blockquote&gt;somewhere between the Pogues, Johnny Cash, Gram Parsons, and Tom Waits,&lt;/blockquote&gt; with just enough punk influence to not just have a twangy Skynard cover band sound.  Their early cover of Jawbreaker’s <cite>Kiss the Bottle</cite> is a perfect example of that synergy.</p>
                <p>I’m also a big fan of Ben’s lyrics, probably due to my propensity for finding myself in those melancholy introspective moments.  Lines like</p>
                <blockquote>I think I'll stay right down here on this floor
Cause if I get back up I'll only fall down more
It ain't the liquor and it ain't the beer that keeps me down
It ain't the sad songs or heartache it ain't even this town </blockquote>
                <p>From the song <cite>I’ll Just Fall</cite></p>
                <p>Or&lt;blockquote&gt;The beer tastes like blood, my mouth is numb
I can’t make the words I need to say</p>
                <p>She had a weakness for writers
And I I was never that good at the words anyways &lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
                <p>From <cite>Nights Like These</cite></p>
                <p>If I were to suggest albums to start with, certainly <cite>Nobody’s Darlings</cite> and <cite>That Much Further West</cite> would top the list, but from my blinders on position, you can’t go wrong with any of their recordings, and as I’ve said, they are a can’t miss live outfit.</p>
                <p>All of Lucero’s music is available on emusic.com.  If you’d like a invite to emusic for a trial membership and 50 free downloads (you’ll have to give a CC#, but they don’t charge until after the first month), leave a comment with the email address you’d like it sent to, and I”ll send one your way. <em> Shameless confession - you can do a trial membership without the invite from me, but if you were to sign up with emusic after the trial via invite, I’d get a 50 song credit</em></p>

                <p>It’s been well documented on the web already, but I figured since I had a few posts on <a href="http://miklb.com/99-dollar-iphone">iphone</a> and <a href="http://miklb.com/calendar-syncing-lightning-google-and-nokia-e62">Nokia</a> syncing, I figured it was worth re-posting that <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/calendar-and-contact-syncing-for-iphone.html">Google announced yesterday</a> that they now supported <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/sync.html">mobile syncing with iPhones</a>, among other platforms.  I haven’t switched from my previous set up <em>yet</em>, but all indications are that it is the same procedure, simply skipping the 3rd party, which is always a plus.</p>
                <p>3rd party web services come and go; there’s little doubt in my mind Google isn’t going anywhere.  It uses the same Exchange server technology, so the same caveat that the previous solution had still exists.  You are only allowed one Exchange server connection, so if for some reason you are using it with say, Exchange, you won’t be able to sync your Google calendar or contacts.</p>

                <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/mattel_football.jpg" class="right" alt="mattel_football" />I must have worn out at least 3 of Mattel’s little hand held football games when I was a kid.  Probably had another 2 confiscated from teachers for playing it during class.</p>
                <p>So it’s no surprise that I’m stoked to see that there is a game for the iPhone heavily influenced by said handheld, and it’s <strong>free this weekend</strong> to boot.  <a href="http://www.touchgrove.com/">TouchGrove</a> is offering their version based on the game, (oh yeah, there was a sequel that was kick butt) until February 2.  Normally only $0.99, this seems like a great marketing plan, as they offer several other games based on similar hand held devices.  For instance I wouldn’t have known that they are working on a baseball game based on a similar handheld which I totally will buy!</p>

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>I’ve thoroughly enjoyed resurrecting this blog over the past 2 months, all the while trying to find the motivation to start food blogging again.  However, the more I search for that motivation, the more I’m drawn to the idea of further consolidating my blogging efforts to this single domain.  It’s not as if I get a huge amount of traffic on my cooking content anyway, and what little there is, should easily migrate over much like bloggingmeta’s traffic did with a permanent redirect.</p>
                <p>One idea I had was to see if I’d do more food blogging by simply posting them to this site first, without migrating the old content, but if I were to succeed in my experiment, I’d find myself in a similar predicament in that I’d have no way to migrate back to the food blog, not to mention I’d potentially be penalizing myself in regards to search engine <em>stuff</em>.</p>
                <p>The primary obstacle is how to migrate the content.  I highly doubt my code-fu would allow me to write a Habari-to-Habari importer by myself, though I’ve not even looked at any of the importers.  I’m not as worried about comments, so I’ve got some too-ashamed-to-disclose hacks I’m contemplating to overcome the importing dilemma.  If anyone wants to help with this goal, I’ll contribute as much as I can to making a formal Habari migration plugin.</p>
                <p>Once I were to overcome that obstacle, the goal then would be to design a magazine-ish style theme that would allow for sections based on tags.  As I find myself blogging more and more about the iPhone, I’ve been <a href="http://twitter.com/miklb/status/1157627875">concerned</a> that it might turn off the few readers I have.  Building on the tag based sections would also allow me to better offer tag based feeds—though I don’t know if it’s possible to create a feed by excluding a tag ;-).  I’m sure I could easily redirect the feed from the cooking site to a /atom/tag/food (or what ever the structure is).</p>
                <p>So I’m hoping that one of the 25 odd subscriber/readers might have an opinion on such a move in both how it might effect me search engine wise, and what your opinion would be on having such a diverse amount of content.</p>

                  Freshbooks, Getting Customer Service Right
      </a>

              <time datetime="2009-01-31T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">31 Jan 2009</time>
              <div class="e-content">
                <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/freshbooks.jpg" alt="Freshbook" class="right" />First off, this isn’t meant as a review of <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/subscribe.php?ref=ef40c79726025-1">Freshbooks</a>.  Suffice to say, I’ve tested many of the online services for billing and time tracking; Freshbooks provides <strong>me</strong> the best solution for <strong>my</strong> needs.  Often though i’ts the intangibles that allow a business to rise above the rest.  For Freshbooks, their customer service certainly is the case.</p>
                <p>Some time during this past fall my Paypal credit card number changed, probably due to losing it, I’m not exactly sure of the circumstances.  Subsequently, many of the services that I use for business, (hosting, domain registration, etc) were effected.  In the case of Freshbooks, I was in an arrangement where I was sub contracting with an individual, getting paid flat rates for the work I was doing, so I didn’t have an immediate need to update the account, unlike say, hosting.  Plus, I tend to be lazy and procrastinate, so it was easy for me to put it off.  Each month, I’d get an email saying that the card had been declined, and I’d say to myself, “I really need to update that,” and then <s>forget to</s>, blow off logging in and updating.</p>
                <p>I ended the previous arrangement earlier this month, around the time I got another one of the reminder emails.  They really are reminders, not nagging or harsh in the least.  I went to log in, and was redirected to a page where I could change/update the contact info, as well the CC#.  However, I didn’t know exactly how much I owed, and since I’m trying to stick to a budget for my web development endeavors, I wanted to know exactly what I owed and plan accordingly—pay it all off or make a couple installment payments.  Never did I entertain the idea of just starting a new account or moving.</p>
                <p>First thing the next morning (I sent the email to support around 9pm EST, which they are on also) I received an email from <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/our-team.php#laleh">Laleh</a> informing me that she had removed the suspended status from my account, rolled me back to their free account in which I could upgrade to a paid plan, and deleted my client list.  Mind you, clients and projects are never really deleted, rather it’s like a super-archived status.  At any time, you can undelete the client/project, and all of the information remains intact.</p>
                <p>They could have easily charged me for the months since the last payment or some portion there of, after all, they were storing my data and settings.  I was fully prepared to pay for this, as my time is valuable, and re-entering client information and setting up the payment gateway again would take a fair amount of time.  Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with the outcome, and an even bigger fan of Freshbooks.</p>
                <p>Ironically, <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/our-team.php#sunir">Sunir</a>, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at Barcamp Orlando (which Freshbooks was a sponsor of, yet another reason to be a fan) posted an article on their blog today about the <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2009/01/30/google-proves-saas-is-hard-even-for-big-guys/">difficulty of Saas</a>.&lt;blockquote&gt;SaaS is not just a new distribution method for software with a lovely revenue stream. It’s a new social contract with the customer that we all have to live up to, whether we’re companies big or small.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Freshbooks more than lived up to their contract, and continue to set the bar for how companies do business on the web.</p>
