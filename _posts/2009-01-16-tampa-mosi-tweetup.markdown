I'm very excited to be attending the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampabloggers/">Tampa TweetUp</a> this Saturday night (1/17/09) at the <a href="http://mosi.org/">Tampa Museum of Science and Industry</a>.  Billed as an unstructured evening for <blockquote>â€¦other local Tweeple who enjoy Twitter, blogging, and all that is social media for an evening of drinks and great conversation. Enjoy a night out of the office or home, Away from your computer, to dork out with others who share similar passions of social networking and have a few drinks.</blockquote>

Not only is this a chance to socialize in person, MOSI is opening up the top of the IMAX dome, giving us an "exclusive 8-story high, 360 degree view of Tampa" (hopefully I'll be able to get a few good pics), the museum will be introducing their <strong>Virtual Ambassador Program</strong>.  From what I gather of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampabloggers/calendar/9377661/">details of the event</a>, MOSI is developing a viral marketing program by giving bloggers and social media persons some <em>swag</em>, including:
<ul>
    <li>One year free membership to the museum</li>
    <li>Free ticket to every IMAX film opening from January - June 2009 (excluding special engagements)</li>
    <li>Free ticket to Body Worlds 3 and the Story of the Heart opening January 22, 2009 - The Original Exhibit of Real Human Bodies.</li>
</ul>
in exchange for a "6 month commitment in helping raise community awareness online about the museum, Body Worlds exhibit, IMAX, and other MOSI offerings".  I have every intention in participating in the program, as I'd certainly enjoy attending events and exhibits and then blogging/Twittering about them afterward.

<img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/tweetup.jpg" alt="tweetup!" class="left">In regards to the TweetUp itself, ever since attending <a href="http://www.barcamporlando.org/">BarCamp Orlando</a>, I've wanted to connect with local bloggers and web geeks like myself.  To that end, I've failed, as scheduling conflicts prevented me from attending <a href="http://barcamptampabay.com/">BarCamp Tampa</a>, as well as a few local blogger meetups.  However, I swore to myself that this year I would make a concerted effort to be available for these events, as well as actively help foster more of them.  I read with envy tweets from people in places like Philadelphia and Orlando who are connecting in real life with other bloggers and developers. I don't want to wait until I'm in a <a href="http://blogorlando.com/">different city</a> to meet and connect with <a href="http://www.sarahintampa.com/">folks who live down the road</a>.

Though I don't consider myself a big "social networker", I do <a href="http://miklb.com/why-twitter-is-just-em-cool-em">love me some Twitter</a>, and certainly understand their place in today's web.  I am actually taking my first steps in embracing a broader view of social networking by integrating some of the features available in <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a> into a site I'm developing for a client.  I've got a long way to go, but it's certainly been an enlightening process, and has undeniably changed my attitude towards sites like Facebook in that just because I personally do not participate in a particular network, it doesn't mean the network has no value.  That said, I don't think I will ever say the same thing about MySpace.
