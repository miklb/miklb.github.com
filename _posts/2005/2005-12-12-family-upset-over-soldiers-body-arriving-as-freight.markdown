<a href="http://www.10news.com/news/5504608/detail.html">10News.com </a>  So our tax dollars can fly Cheney and his staff all over the country on fund raising jaunts, and stump speeches, but we can't give the men and women who fall in the line of duty fighting <em>his</em> war the proper and respectful transport <strong>all the way</strong> from the battle field to their home town.  Just one more disgusting fact from this administration.
