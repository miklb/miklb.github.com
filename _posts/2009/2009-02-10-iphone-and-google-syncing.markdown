It's been well documented on the web already, but I figured since I had a few posts on <a href="http://miklb.com/99-dollar-iphone">iphone</a> and <a href="http://miklb.com/calendar-syncing-lightning-google-and-nokia-e62">Nokia</a> syncing, I figured it was worth re-posting that <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/calendar-and-contact-syncing-for-iphone.html">Google announced yesterday</a> that they now supported <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/sync.html">mobile syncing with iPhones</a>, among other platforms.  I haven't switched from my previous set up <em>yet</em>, but all indications are that it is the same procedure, simply skipping the 3rd party, which is always a plus.

3rd party web services come and go; there's little doubt in my mind Google isn't going anywhere.  It uses the same Exchange server technology, so the same caveat that the previous solution had still exists.  You are only allowed one Exchange server connection, so if for some reason you are using it with say, Exchange, you won't be able to sync your Google calendar or contacts.
