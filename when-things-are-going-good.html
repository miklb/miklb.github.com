<meta name="description" content="When things are going good, they are really good.  I can’t say a bad thing about my life right now, looking forward to my classes, have a great paying job lined up that starts in a month, doing some cool stuff on the web, just over all good.  So my printer went out.  An Epson 5400 all-in-one.  Bought it about 16 months ago for $130 after rebates.  But we bought the 2 year warranty.  So, I go to trade it in today, and obviously the 5400 is an older model.  They’ve got the 6600.  Ok, they credit me the $150, the 6600 is $189 after instant rebate.  Eh, $39 isn’t bad.  But wait.  There are some mail in rebates.  How much you ask.  $110 worth!!!  So, I pay $80 out of my pocket today, will get $110 back within 6 weeks, have a brand new printer, and a 2 year no questions asked warranty.  Sweet!Even without the trade in deal, you can get that printer for $79 through the 26th of August at CompUSA.  Still not a bad deal." />

      <p>When things are going good, they are really good.  I can’t say a bad thing about my life right now, looking forward to my classes, have a great paying job lined up that starts in a month, doing some cool stuff on the web, just over all good.  So my printer went out.  An Epson 5400 all-in-one.  Bought it about 16 months ago for $130 after rebates.  But we bought the 2 year warranty.  So, I go to trade it in today, and obviously the 5400 is an older model.  They’ve got the 6600.  Ok, they credit me the $150, the 6600 is $189 after instant rebate.  Eh, $39 isn’t bad.  But wait.  There are some mail in rebates.  How much you ask.  $110 worth!!!  So, I pay $80 out of my pocket today, will get $110 back within 6 weeks, have a brand new printer, and a 2 year no questions asked warranty.  Sweet!
Even without the trade in deal, you can get that printer for $79 through the 26th of August at CompUSA.  Still not a bad deal.</p>
