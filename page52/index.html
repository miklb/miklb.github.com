        <p>There has been much buzz the past week regarding comment/trackback spam around the net.  Discussions regarding a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/16/AR2006051601873.html">cyber spam war</a>, threads all over the WP support forums, and blog post after blog post regarding spam.  Meanwhile, I sit wondering am I missing out on something?  Do the spammers simply not like me?  I’ve gotten one or two Spam Karma digests, with a few caught spams over the past week, but nothing like the “100s” of spams I’ve seen people mention.  I didn’t think I was doing anything exceptional to protect against spam.  I’m running <a href="http://www.homelandstupidity.us/software/bad-behavior/">Bad Behavior</a> and <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/">Spam Karma 2</a>.  No Akismet, the golden child of WP lead developer Matt Mullenweg, no captchas, nothing else.<br />
Then I wonder, is it because I’ve donated to both plugin developers, that I really do have Spam Karma on my side?  Either way, know if and when I get an adsense deposit, that a portion of it will go again to both plugin developers, just in case ;-)</p>

        Saudi Men Board High School Bus

I’m not quite sure what to make of this, but I have to agree, the substitute driver should have had better training in how to handle riders that seem not to be students.  However, I can also understand the level of concern, and truthfully feel the authorities are handling this in the proper manner.  I don’t care if they are Saudi or not, two adults boarding a high school bus, and not showing complete remorse when told of what they’ve done requires further investigation.  I’m not a fan of racial profiling to say the least , however, in today’s climate, all precaution should be taken.  And as I said, any adult not showing remorse sends a signal to me.  You have to think the driver and students were on the edge of their seat the whole ride, and were happy to see  swarm of police when they arrived at school.  What I hope not to see is a rash of law suits from well to do parents claiming negligence on the drivers part.  That will accomplish nothing, but strap an already over burden school system with legal fees and potentially worse.</p>

<p>Clearly something needs to be clarified about how to handle similar situations, and at least in this area, better training and incentives for drivers need to be in place, as anytime something “scary” or worse happens, its a substitute driver at the wheel.</p>

Not only am I moving this site and the subdomains, I’m moving two other domains to the new server.  I’ve ventured into the realm of managing multiple domains.  Yay! (not).  Anyway, it’s a headache but at least once it’s done, it’s done.  A Small Orange looks like great hosting so I shouldn’t have to worry about this again for a LONG time.</p>

<p>When will it stop?  What has to happen for the voices of the sanity and democracy to rise above this administration and reign it back in?<br />
I’ve not posted about this really, as it seems everyone else has said it more eloquently than I, but at this point, I think people simply need to continue to put it out there, don’t let it go away with another news cycle about another cute blonde disappearing in the tropics (as sad as the story is, it shouldn’t be prime time news, <em>every night</em>).
And instead of coming clean tonight, he’s going to talk about sending soldiers to the southern border.<br />
