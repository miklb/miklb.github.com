                  I’d really like to meet the genius who came up with this idea.  “Hey, we can turn a negative into a positive if we simply start counting any puddle as wetlands.  Heck, the golf course that surrounds my new house must have at least 15 ponds, let’s start counting those…ah screw the pesticides and fertilizers that filter into the ponds…”.
As a Florida native, it breaks my heart every time I take a drive through an area that once used to be “swampy”, and now is condo, or subdivision.  I do enjoy playing golf, but would never trade a cypress swamp for a course.  And nor do I think my goverment should either.</p>

                <p>Sign me up.  Got the call from the local cable company, Brighthouse tonight saying that with our current package, I can add VOIP telephone and and twice as much download rates for Road Runner for basically half of what I pay monthly for my traditional phone service.  And they claim they have battery backup for phone service in case of power outage (we keep an old fashioned phone around for those just in case moments, though a cell phone now makes it less used).  How can you beat that.  And one less bill a month to deal with.<br />
                  So if anyone has any experience with the digital phone service, I’ve still got two weeks before they come to install, I’d really love some feedback.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.votejan.com/">Jan Schneider for Congress</a>Just a note to any readers in  Congressional district 13, to support Jan Schneider in her attempt to take the seat vacated by Katherine Harris.  I’ve gotten several emails pushing for her support, and come across a couple of blog posts as well, so I took a minute to check out her credentials.  Not your soccer mom got bored, or super rich white girl with nothing better to do type of candidate.  It’s also my understanding that a recent Democrat convert is being supported by the DNC.  I hope that’s not the case, and all because one may have a few more dollars than the other.  Shame shame.</p>
                <p>I’d love to know more about this one, so if you have any details, do share.</p>
