                <p>Seems Habari can’t use Technorati’s quick claim process, so I was asked to paste a little code in a post, so the claim process could proceed.  Hopefully this will be quick.  I will say that Lev with Technorati was very nice and apologetic regarding the issue, and offered any more assistance necessary.</p>

                <p>I just got my invite for the alpha testing (yes, alpha, not beta) of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>, and I can say with certainty that I love it, and am ready to buy it now.  It just seems to be intuitive enough with just the right amount of features (and it’s not done).  I certainly hope that the main interface doesn’t get clogged up like many other GTD apps have done trying to be too many things to too many people.  I especially like that you can group projects.  I’ll blog more once I’ve really had a chance to dig into it a bit more, but if you are Mac using GTD’er, you really should <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/listinfo/omnifocus-beta-announce">sign up for the beta-announcement list</a>, especially if you are not happy with the other options out there.</p>

                <p>I’m confused. I set an <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt; h2 &gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> tag with an #id, and give it a background image.  I want both the image and the text to be a clickable link.  Thus, I want to wrap the <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt; h2 &gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> tag <strong>inside</strong> the anchor tag.  Validator tells me it’s not valid HTML.  I set the anchor to a class of .block, which is defined as &lt;pre&gt;.block {display:block}&lt;/pre&gt;.  Still doesn’t validate.  Do you see the logic? Or, am I just making a mistake?</p>

                <p>I’ve been reading more and more about the concept, and have tried using some Photoshop tools for helping with the concept when doing up a layout mock, but watching and listening to Khoi Vinh and Mark Boulton talk about it from their session at the SXSW Interactive helped immensely.  You can read more about Khoi’s presentation, as well as <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2007/0318_oh_yeeaahh.php">download the slides in .pdf format on his blog, Subtraction</a>, and download the podcast from the <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/blogs/podcasts.php/2007/05/">official SXSW site.</a><em>scroll down about 2/3 of the way for the link</em>.  Certainly a lot of good information in the comments on the blog as well, particularly links to books about the subject.</p>
