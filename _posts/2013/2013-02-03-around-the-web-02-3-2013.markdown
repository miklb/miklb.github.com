I'm tempted to test out Omni Focus since they are offering a free license until 2.0 is released. Seems like a nice starting point for jumping into the system. Just not sure ready for the outlay of cash for iOS versions and desktop since I've bought Things already…

Nice little bookmarklet for testing your design in common resolutions. Provides a handy *toolbar* to click between layouts or add your own custom size.

Always nice to have a couple of mackerel recipes. This one reminds me of Lyonnaise Potatoes, which I learned to brush the potatoes with a little dijon mustard. I think it would be a nice touch to brush the mackerel with the mustard in this recipe.

Always interesting to see how others are using nvAlt. Not sure where I'd be without it.
