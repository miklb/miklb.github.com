            <p>So if anyone has an “old school” flickr account, they too received an email a while back saying that as of March 15th, they needed to merge with a yahoo id.  I had a yahoo id, which I never really use.  And like most people, they are probably a bit attached to their online identities.  Obviously, I use miklb where ever I can.  I was a bit upset at the prospect of losing my flickr account of /miklb.  Granted, the yahoo account I have is miklb.online, but somehow that just isn’t what I wanted.  So I procrastinated in making the switch.  Finally, today, I went about looking into it, as I didn’t want to get locked out of my moblog images.  (Currently, I do not have a cell service with a camera phone, but not all of those images are still on my old phone, anyway…) I went to the flickr account, and saw the “merge” accounts option.  I went to merge miklb with yahoo id miklb.online.  No go.  miklb.online was already associated with flickr.  Ugh.  When did I do that?</p>
            <p>So looking at that account, I hadn’t actually uploaded any images, so I saw I could delete the flickr account for that ID.  I didn’t know if I could then re-associate it, but what the heck, I figured I’d give it a shot.  I deleted the yahoo id from flickr, and tried again to merge, still thinking I’d become miklb.online.  In the meantime, I found a flickr export app for the Mac, <a href="http://sunkencity.org/flickrbackup/">Flickrbackup</a>, grabbed my images just in case, and then made the association between the old school account and the yahoo id.  All went smooth, and to my surprise, I get to keep the miklb account, I simply now log in with the yahoo id.  Excellent.  Perhaps this will move me to use flickr a bit more, I know I’d love to get a friend of mine to use it, but he’s a myspacer, and I don’t even know what he’s using to host his images.  (Goody Goody, I’ll even set you up with a blog if you make the switch from myspace).
So, long story short, it was far less painful to make the switch, and if you haven’t done so, fret not, if you have to be pumpkinpatch6969 instead of your favorite handle, you’ll not loose your flickr name.</p>

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>I’ve long been a customer and ardent “word-of-mouth” supporter of Metro PCS.  Heck, they even added web browsing (albeit a handcuffed version).  However, after my experience with their customer support today, I can not advocate the company, or will no longer be a customer.  I’ve always wondered if their business model was really aimed at low-income people looking for a quick and easy cell phone option, and now I think that’s the case.  A genuine desire to hang onto long time customers certainly wasn’t in my experience today.
Long story short, I’m a procrastinator.  I simply wait until the last minute to pay bills.  Certainly I’m working on fixing that defect, see my post about GTD and a desire to at least <em>know</em> that a bill is due.  So last night I tried paying my bill, the last day.  Nothing uncommon on my end, I’ve done it routinely since I got the service.  However, last night, I couldn’t process the online payment gateway.  Tried again today, still no luck, so I called their payment service customer support.  First agent said turn off pop-up blockers.  I explained I’ve never had that issue before, but humored them and tried.  No luck.  I call back, this time I’m asked, “are you using FireFox Mozilla?”  “Yes”, I replied. Nut shell- they stopped supporting Mozilla.  No explanation, just, “use IE.”</p>
            <p><em>I started this some time ago, and it’s been sitting as a draft, so I figured I’d wrap it up as I just mentioned Flickr and mobblogging</em>
              After I let the account lapse, I procrastinated some more, not signing up with another service, to the point I figured I’d go ahead and keep Metro PCS for a little longer.  I paid my bill, (approx a month later) and service was back on.  The next morning, I get a text message saying I need to pay another $60.  So I try calling them to find out what was going on.  I probably spent an hour just finding a phone number where I could speak with a human being.  I finally had to call an authorized reseller in St. Petersburg (I live in Tampa) to get a number.  They informed me that though I don’t have a contract, their policy is that you pay for the month of service, even if the phone wasn’t in use.  I said that was unacceptable, and wanted a refund.  That I did get.  But never in the whole process did anyone acknowledge that the whole issue arose from their poor web interface, and offer to simply waive a month, or any reconnect fees to keep me as a customer.</p>
            <p>Some irony to that is that when ever I would end a conversation with a rep, they would say “we value your business here at Metro PCS”.  Did they really?  I think not.  I highly suggest looking at other alternatives to their service, as I do not think they care about long term customers, and are more in the business of short term, “turn and burn” clientele.</p>

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>Well, two months into the year, and I’m still struggling with a good GTD system.  I am using Actiontastic still, but for work, I’m using <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com">Fresh Books</a> to time track and invoice clients.  (For those that care, I’ve gone full time into web work.  Mostly WordPress, but I’ve done a fair amount of non-WP work.  My working site is <a href="http://www.bishopblogworks.com">Bishop Blog Works</a>. Please understand the design is in flux).</p>
            <p>Fresh Books is great, but I can’t get my clients to use the ticket system.  Email is still their method of choice for notifying me of needed changes, for both active projects, and site tweaks.  Fresh Books says they will have an email to ticket system, but if that doesn’t materialize sooner than later, I may have to look at another option.  In the meantime, I try to take the email, add it to iCal as a todo using <a hfref="http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html">Mailtags</a>, then sync iCal with Actiontastic, and THEN add those as tickets/tasks in Fresh Books.</p>
            <p>Not working out so well.</p>
            <p>On a positive note, I’ve streamlined the home office, clearing out a lot of clutter, which I believe makes it easier to get started in the morning and stay focused.</p>
            <p>If anyone has a suggestion for converting emails to a time tracking system, I’d love to hear about it.  I have started looking at <a href="http://kingdesign.net/tasks/">Alex King’s Tracks </a>, as it has an email to task ability, but the demo doesn’t seem to allow for that.  It requires running a cron job on your server, and since Alex is setting the demo up on his, I don’t see a way to test that feature.  If it works, I could have clients send an email that is picked up by Tasks, and then time track straight from that.  But then I’m back to either having two “apps” for time tracking/invoicing.  Hopefully Fresh Books will roll out that feature soon, and I’ll be good to go.  I then simply forward a copy of the ticket to Mail.app, add it to Actiontastic, and it’s automatically added to a ticket.  Or at least that’s how I’d draw it up on paper.</p>

            <p>Nothing like a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/habari/">new blog engine</a> to get the blood pumping.  Not that I’m jumping ship, just looking to broaden horizons, and see what new and exciting might be around the corner.  I’m a big fan of a couple of people involved, not such a fan of a few others.

            <p><em>This is the first of probably several posts for, primarily my own benefit, documenting my implementation of the GTD system</em></p>
            <p>Well, a bit late in getting a “New Years” post up, but I’m fighting a heavy does of procrastination and a head cold, so I thought “no time better than the present”.  Several months ago, I discovered Merlin Mann’s <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a>, probably via a link from a Mac site.  There I found my first introduction to the concept of “Getting Things Done”, which is a book and much more from <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">David Allen.</a>  Like most people, I find myself constantly feeling unorganized, confused, and wrought with anxiety as I’m not “getting shit done.”  So I began reading some posts, exploring the multitude of applications discussed, and “lurking”.</p>
            <p>The first application that I explored, which isn’t directly a GTD app, but one meant to provide more productivity in using your Mac was <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>.  This free application really is something that should be built into the OS, but that’s for another discussion.  Suffice to say, once you get a hang of the app, you may never really touch your mouse or use the dock again.  (Well, not really, but it is safe to say you will use the mouse much less, and the dock, well, that can be eliminated.)</p>
            <p>From there, I began reading more and more about the GTD concept, and decided it was time to get the book.  My frugal nature led me to my local library, however, the waiting list for the book was 57 people (I’ve yet to be notified by the library that a copy was available for me).  So procrastination took over, I blew off several trips to the book store, and I continued my struggle with knowing what I needed to be doing.</p>
            <p>Finally, on New Years Eve, my muse purchased the book for me, and I immediately began reading.  It was as if the book had been written for me (I’m sure most people feel that way upon first reading).  I’m not going to try and explain the concept, I don’t think I could do it justice, but a brief overview is that it’s intended to get ALL the things that people generally keep in their head, be it work, home, or personal, and put them into a system that allows to track them.  It also introduces the idea of breaking “projects”, that is, anything that has more than one step, into “next actions”.  So instead of having a to do list with “landscape yard” item, you have a project, and then steps to accomplishing the task.  The goal is to remove those from your head, those nagging, “I know I should be doing…” type things, and allow you to concentrate on the “doing”.  This should alleviate the stress and anxiety from the daily routine.  Sounds perfect.</p>
            <p>The next step is to find a system that works for you.  David Allen doesn’t necessarily have a specific system, just a concept.  Many, many systems exist, some paper based, some electronic, some a mix.  As I work completely on the computer now (<em>crossing fingers that sticks</em>), a computer based system seems most logical.  So off I went looking for a system.</p>
            <p>My first stop was a FireFox extension <a href="http://www.gtdgmail.com/">GTDGmail</a>, which hacks into your gmail account, and provides for project creation, contexts (that is, “where” or “how” you do the task, @phone, @errands, etc).  It was a good primer on the concept, and has helped in managing my many emails from clients.  However, soon it became clear that wasn’t sufficient enough for me for the entirety of the GTD system.</p>
            <p>I’ve looked at <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/journal/archives/2006/06/189.html">ideas</a> for using <a href="http://backpackit.com/">BackPack</a>, which I like, but ultimately, didn’t seem like the best solution for me.  I’ve also looked at several of the wiki hacks, as well as the <a href="http://kinkless.com/">Kinkless</a> system.  Which, seems well done, but as it requires Omni Outliner Pro, I wasn’t ready to invest in more software.  Apparently Omni Group is working on OmniFocus, a full fledged app implementing what Kinkless does with Omni Outliner, and worth keeping an eye on.</p>
            <p>Which leads me to my final decision.  Currently, I’m using <a href="http://www.kaboomerang.com/blog/">Actiontastic</a>, which is still in beta, and will be an app that will have to be purchased at some point.  It integrates with quicksilver, so I can easily add items to my inbox without actually moving to the app (for instance, while typing this, if I remember I need to buy TP, I can easily send that to the app with a few keystrokes).  I’ve also looked at <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">Tracks</a>, a Ruby on Rails application that can either be installed locally on my Mac, or hosted on my server.  Hosting it on my server would give me the ability to access it from any computer, and though I haven’t explored it completely, I’m guessing now that I have internet access on my phone, I could add items from the phone’s browser (or at least via email/SMS).  If you are interested in testing Tracks, you can visit a free hosted version at <a href="http://tracks.tra.in/login">Tracks Train</a>.</p>
            <p>No matter which I choose, the bottom line is I need to now actually implement the system, so I can actually start “doing”, which is a caveat of sorts.  It really is a matter of dedicating time to do it.  It’s really not something that can be done in spurts, or half way.  I think that is the real reason for blogging it, a challenge to myself to really get it in gear.  I intend on blogging more about the process, as both a way to share, and a means of archiving the process for my own benefit, especially if a new, or better “system” comes along.  I’ve all but decided to go with Actiontastic, so the next step will be to nail down the contexts for my system.</p>
