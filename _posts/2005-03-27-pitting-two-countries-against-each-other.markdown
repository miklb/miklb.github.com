So, the US decides they are going to sell military jets to both India and Pakistan.  I actually heard about the Pakistan offer first.  Geez, I thought, that's some reward to a renegade dictator for allowing the US to use his country.  Sure, the fact that rumors circulate that Pakistanis have aided Bin Laden, and prior to their agreement, were considered a terrorist nation.  That's not to mention the ongoing feud, which has resulted in numerous wars with India.  So what does our illustrious leader do, he offers the same deal to India.  Brilliant.  Force them both to escalate an arms race, to benefit his sorry ass economy.  If he can't kick start it the old fashion way, he'll do it, well, maybe that is the old fashion way.
I wonder how betrothed these countries would be to the US if they decide to attack, oh, let's say, Syria, to use those planes in such an action.  Not only would that benefit the US military, it would benefit the argument of a "coalition".

All the deal needs is a bow, I suppose.
