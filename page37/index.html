                <p>A few months ago, I came across <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme">Jon Hicks’ Mac inspired Google Reader</a>, but recently noticed the version I was using was outdated, and Google Reader wasn’t looking so hot.  Off I went in search of an update, and subsequent posts on Jon’s site, found <a href="http://userstyles.org">User Styles</a>.  Though the site could use some better search functionality, I really like it in the sense that you can easily add styles via the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108">Stylish</a> extension for Firefox.  I’ve employed <a href="http://miklb.com/custom-style-sheets-and-basecamp">Stylish for BaseCamp</a>, and have thought more about how it could be used, User Styles gives plenty to think about now.</p>

                <p>For many reasons, I have not used the streaming music from <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>.  That is, until today.  I first read a <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060507110841475">hint</a> on how to use iTunes and Apple Scripts, however, that solution didn’t work.  Another comment on the hint pointed to <a href="http://amua.sourceforge.net/">Amua</a>, which basically streams the music via iTunes.  Excellent stuff.  I now can stream my last.fm music through my stereo, using the Airport Express.  If you are a last.fm user, by all means, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/miklb">add me as a friend</a>, or at least check out my musical tastes.  Though still a bit buggy, my <a href="http://miklb.com/lifestream">Lifestream</a> also tracks my most currently played selections.</p>

                <p>Can someone please tell <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/">The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> to start a new iPhone blog, and leave my feedreader free of half a dozen or more posts everyday about the iPhone?

                <p>It seems that there is quite the difference in how Habari is developed from a PHP standpoint to a design standpoint.  Code wise, most major changes that I’ve seen, a patch was sent out to the community, and comments were made about how it worked, and if it worked within the general scope of where the members and community saw development.</p>
                <p>This has not been the  case, from what I can see, with a current movement to change the entire admin interface.  There was some discussion about the possibility of incorporating <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">BluePrint CSS Framework</a> into the admin interface.  The general consensus was that it wasn’t a bad idea, but that there were concerns with it’s compatibilities with all browsers.  In that discussion however, there was no talk of a “live” redesign of the interface.  Meaning, the admin would be changed in trunk, at small increments, without any discussion of the changes, or the effects of those changes on the user experience.</p>
