Regularly during the baseball season Olbermann waxes on both current and past baseball events on his Baseball Nerd blog.  I’m not sure I’ve read a better example than his latest <a href="http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/11/this_just_infrom_1894.html">This Just In…From 1984</a>, showing a possibly never before seen page from a periodical of the time with images of a long lost championship game.  The fact he can give players names and anecdotes for many of those involved lends to the grainy images from a bygone era.  The juxtaposed image from the periodical with one of his own snapshots from the ‘09 World Series truly brings the past and present of baseball together brilliantly (despite it being the Yankees).  I highly recommend subscribing to the blog if you are a true lover of baseball.</p>

              Transmit &amp; Textmate No Longer Sitting in a Tree

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>For years, my work tools/flow has primarily consisted of using Transmit for for (S)FTP, and TextMate for all file editing save for CSS files,  for which I use CSSEdit.  It worked like a charm.  I could be on 3 different servers, jumping from issue to issue, project to project, and never miss a beat. Now I know my hard core programmer friends will say I should be using something like VIM, which I’d love to be that guy, but my skills at modifying PHP would never allow me to work like that.  I like the code completion, syntax highlighting, and <em>pretty</em> GUI of a desktop app.</p>
            <p>So this little work flow had become second nature.  I never really thought about it anymore.  For those not familiar with TextMate, associated files in a project open in tabs, ala browsers.  Otherwise, they are simply each a new window.  Originally I was using the <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/06/13/use-tabs-in-textmate-for-remote-files-opened-by-transmit/">Muffin Research tutorial </a>on how to get the temp Transmit files in a TextMate project.  With the excellent update to version 4 of Transmit, a new <a href="http://blog.taenzer.me/textmate-open-files-from-ftp-in-tabs-with-tra">tutorial</a> surfaced dealing with the new way temp files were handled.  I followed along, things worked great. Until now.</p>
            <p>After a recent update to Transmit, I realized the temp files were no longer opening as a project in TextMate.  I tweeted about it, and soon after someone from Panic asked me to send a support email.  I enthusiastically did, hoping I had missed something.  Unfortunately, the reply was:</p>
            <blockquote>Hi Michael, unfortunately I can’t guarantee that this functionality will return. It’s not something that’s supported by the ODB Editor suite. Really, this is a feature that needs to be added to TextMate in the same way that browsers can be told to open new windows in tabs.</blockquote>
            <p>I politely replied that TextMate does have that feature, the associated files just need to be in a project.  Once again, the response was that I should open a feature request ticket with TextMate that files open as tabs regardless of being associated with a project, followed by</p>
            <blockquote>We fixed a legitimate bug with editing files in BBEdit and this was an unintended side-effect.  However, it’s unfair of you to claim that this was a supported feature of Transmit as it relied on accessing a hidden cache folder in order to function.</blockquote>
            <p>There was an additional suggestion along the way that I could mount the remote servers using the built in MacFUSE technology as folders on my desktop.  I’m not inclined to use that for my work server however.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I was offered a refund if rolling back to 4.1.1 wasn’t an option.  Certainly I do not want to be stuck with that version forever, but in the meantime I’ve rolled back so I can continue on my current work flow, while investigating other options.  I’ve downloaded Panic’s Coda application, which is an svn client, FTP and file editor all rolled into one (plus terminal).  I had tested it on its initial release, and didn’t find it anywhere near my existing setup.  I’ve not used it enough in its current form to know if it’s mature enough to compete.  Certainly I’m not a heavy programmer, so a lot of times TextMate can be overkill.  I look forward to testing it further.</p>
            <p>In an ideal world, there would be a simple way for Transmit to store the temp files as in the past where TextMate can easily find them as a project.  Or TextMate 2 drops overnight and has built in support for opening files unassociated with a project as tabs.  I’m certainly open to suggestions.</p>
            <p>Lastly, let me be clear.  I did not mean to imply this was a “supported” feature, rather it just <em>worked</em>.  James, the Panic support person who corresponded with me over this issue was nothing but professional, polite and honest.  Refreshingly honest.  They make a great product, one that has almost seamlessly fit into my system without even noticing it most days.  I sincerely appreciate their offer of refunding my purchase.  That was never my goal.  I’ve gotten far more value out of my purchase of that application to ever accept the refund, regardless of my ultimate direction.  I just want the perfect marriage back.</p>

            <p>When I was going through a really bad breakup about 10 years ago, a friend gave me two CD’s. Ryan Adam’s <cite>Heartbreaker</cite> and Whiskeytown’s <cite>Whiskeytown</cite>. I still turn to those two recordings when things are going bad. Adam’s lyrics and voice strike a distinct nerve with me, and is the perfect companion to a bottle of bourbon and introspection.</p>
            <p>I came across this video of Whiskeytown covering the Gram Parson song “A Song for You”, and it resonates for many of the same reasons.</p>
            <iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9hNExzwlhA?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

            <p>This isn’t a video, rather the original by Graham Parsons with Emmylou Harris set to some great old photos of Florida and Georgia (Parsons was born in Winter Haven, FL).  This too struck a nerve.</p>
            <p>Only in the last few years have I begun to really appreciate Parsons, but rediscovering this song will certainly spur me on to learn more.</p>
            <p>On a side note, the woman playing fiddle in Whiskeytown, Caitlin Cary is awesome in her own right.  If you haven’t listened to a more current project she’s in, Tres Chicas, or any of her solo stuff, I highly recommend seeking it out.</p>

            <p><img src="/user/images/CCB.png" class="right" alt="Cigar City Brewing" />A <a href="http://blog.cigarcitybeer.com/2010/11/10/255-the-tasting-room-needs-your-help-again.aspx">plea from Cigar City Brewing</a> came across my Twitter feed this morning via <a href="http://www.independenttampa.com/">The Independent - Tampa</a>.  This is a perfect example of why I am going to start using my blog more and not just Twitter. Sure, I could retweet the link, say 3-4 words on it, but I want to fully comment on the situation.</p>
            <p>The nutshell, the Tampa City Council failed to make permanent the wet zoning license and extend the hours for the tasting room of Cigar City Brewing.  I’ve watched enough city council meetings to know this is generally a no brainer for a business like this that has had zero incidents.  But for those that don’t live in Tampa or not as familiar, the owner of the CCB’s father has some high profile businesses that have clashed with the city for years.  These city council members are punishing the son for issues they may have with the father.  I know this because I watched the original city council meeting when they went for their license and zoning originally.  They didn’t <em>trust</em> that this would be a legitimate business. Or at least those were the implications. That somehow this would all be a ruse to get some kind wet zoning and turn into some other type of business.</p>
            <p>Little does the backwards uninformed who failed to vote on this know, but Cigar City Brewing is known nationally, internationally if you include Canada. Their beers are recognized and respected amongst some of the biggest and best micro-breweries.  Shutting down the tasting room, or at the least minimizing it’s ability to do business, is a travesty and yet another sign of how far Tampa really is behind the times.</p>
            <p>So if you are a craft beer fan not in Tampa, perhaps follow one of the links from the CCB site and tell a council member about your support for the art and the quality of the beer from CCB. If you do live in the city limits, please tell Ms. Miller, Rev. Scott (who is running for mayor? really you’d not want a world class business like this to not succeed?) and Mr. Stokes (oh, on second thought I will run for city council after telling you I wouldn’t) that not supporting this permanent license is a travesty and a disservice to the city.</p>
