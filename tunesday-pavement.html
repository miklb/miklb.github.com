  <div class="e-content">
      <p><a href="http://satoridesigns.blogspot.com/2004/12/primus-sonic-youth-mudhoney-pavement.html"><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/redrocks_92_web.jpg" alt="ticketstub" class="right" /></a>For my second installment of <a href="http://miklb.com/tag/tunesday">Tunesday</a>, I thought I’d do a little reminiscing and highlight my single most favorite band of the ’90s, <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/Pavement-MP3-Download/10514495.html">Pavement</a>.  Certainly it’s always difficult to say “favorite band”, or “favorite song”.  Heck, its often difficult for me to say “top ten…”, but I can honestly say that Pavement is my favorite band from that time, and is still a band that gets heavy rotation.</p>

<p>I discovered Pavement in the fall of ‘92.  Discovered probably isn’t the best characterization, as I didn’t know who they were when I saw their name as the opening act for the incredible lineup of Mudhoney, Sonic Youth and Primus (it’s amazing what you can find with a Google search.  The ticket stub, complete with the relatively cheap price of $17.60 is from that show).  The show was at the legendary open air amphitheater Red Rocks.  I had moved to Denver that spring, and this was my first visit to the venue.  I was only familiar  with Red Rocks from the classic U2 concert video, <cite>Under a Blood Red Sky</cite>, but all of my friends in Denver spoke of it with reverence.  I was a huge fan of both Mudhoney and Sonic Youth (still am), and though not a zealot in regards to Primus like some, I had seen them earlier that year in a small club in Tampa and knew they’d be a nice way to end the evening and was really looking forward to the show.</p>

<p>Anyway, Pavement were setting up to open the show, and they really looked like a bunch of roadies who were a pick up band to just warm up the crowd.  A bunch of young guys, with this considerably older drummer who came out, stood on his stool, and in one fell swoop, dropped to a seated position and kicked off the first song.  It was love at first note.</p>

<p>Pavement is now considered one of the trailblazers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music">lo-fi sound</a>, along with bands like Sebadoh and the lesser known outfit <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Slint-Tweez-MP3-Download/10910132.html">Slint</a>.  Often coming across as dissonant and harmonic at the same time, with intelligent, sometimes cryptic lyrics, their dynamic sound is infectious. (And that’s where I stop trying to sound like a music writer. )</p>

<p>Pavement broke up somewhere around the fall of ‘99, but not before putting out 5 albums, and a slew of EPs, including my favorite of all their recordings, <cite>Watery, Domestic</cite>.  As far as must haves, their first two full length albums, <cite>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</cite> and <cite>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</cite> should be in every fan of ’90s, American indie rock library.  Of the last 3, it’s decidedly split amongst fans which were better, with me being in the <cite>Brighten the Corners</cite> camp.</p>

<p>Steve Malkmus continues to record and perform with his band the Jicks, and fellow guitarist Scott <em>“Spiral Stairs”</em> Kannberg has recorded a couple of albums with the band <cite>Preston School of Industry</cite>.  I quite enjoy <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Preston-School-Of-Industry-Monsoon-MP3-Download/10813493.html">Monsoon</a>, particularly the track <cite>Caught in the Rain</cite>.</p>

<p>I stumbled onto an interview recently with Malkmus in which he was asked about the possibility of a Pavement reunion, and he seemed to imply the door was open.  I’m not sure they’d be able to recapture the magic, or if it would just be a nostalgic trip down memory lane, but either way, I’d be one of the first in line to see it.</p>

<p>Pavement recorded all of their albums with the label Matador Records, and are all available, along with expanded re-releases of several of their albums at emusic.com. If you’d like an invite to emusic for a trial membership and 50 free downloads (you’ll have to give a CC#, but they don’t charge until after the first month), leave a comment with the email address you’d like it sent to, and I”ll send one your way. <em> Shameless confession - you can do a trial membership without the invite from me, but if you were to sign up with emusic after the trial via invite, I’d get a 50 song credit</em>.</p>
