<em>*EDIT- I have opted back to my original look, as I wasn't happy with where things were.  I may simply change a few things with this look,  mainly the header image.</em>

Pardon the dust, but I've switched over to a custom designed theme.  It's more of a cobbling together of ideas from other themes, than a totally custom design, aside from the header image, that is.  The boxes on the side bar are from the travelogue theme, and I've probably hacked some other stuff without even realizing it, lord knows I looked under the hood at a dozen or so themes before starting this one.  So if you have any issues, please comment in this thread.  I may add a theme switcher, so if viewers totally hate it, they can swap to another look.  Thanks for stopping by, and looking around.
