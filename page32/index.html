            <p>I’ve made some small changes to <a href="/mzingi">the mzingi</a> theme, most notably a few code changes to work with the most current revision. (1267 at time of writing).</p>
            <p>This includes fixing the atom feed link, addressing plugin hooks in the header and footer, and removing some extraneous code in the commentform that has been moved to the theme class.</p>
            <p>Also, some minor styling for the date has been added, as well as a screenshot and license.</p>
            <p>Also added is the conditional code in the header to show the title on the home page as the blog title, or the post title followed by the blog title in single post pages.</p>
            <p>A few things I’m looking to do in the next revision is to remove the Asides code, and add a template for the linkoid plugin, so if a user doesn’t want to use Asides, they don’t have to edit the theme, as well as leverage the ability of the plugin to allow the user to chose their own tags to be used in the feature and excluded from the primary content.</p>
            <p>Also planned is author comment highlighting.</p>
            <p>Suggestions are always warmly welcomed.</p>

            <p>I’m quite happy to see a new Habari user, Dylan, over at Trifold Design, has created a <a href="http://blog.trifolddesigns.com/textile-2-0-0-plugin-for-habari">Textile plugin for Habari</a>.  I too use many of the same tools Dylan does, and find myself using that markup more and more, even in email and on IRC (though, embarrassingly I didn’t realize it was actually Textile).</p>
            <p>I haven’t actually tested the plugin yet, though it did install fine, and it’s a .5 release, so I assume the author has vetted it himself.</p>
            <p>Also, welcome to the community Dylan, it’s always great to see new people join in.</p>
            <p>For those that are looking for other markup plugins, you might look at Matt Read’s <a href="http://drunkenmonkey.org/projects/habari-markdown"> Markdown</a> plugin as well.</p>

            <p>I recently had upgraded to Leopard, and one FireFox extension I’ve come to count on was <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125">It’s All Text!</a>.  Which allows you to chose a text editor of your choice to edit text fields.  Sometimes I need to do some code changes for sites in a text box, or work with a large amount of text, and it was quite handy to simply edit with TextMate.  It seemed to have broken in Leopard.  I checked the settings, and changing the path to &lt;pre&gt;/usr/bin/mate&lt;/pre&gt; from &lt;pre&gt;/usr/local/bin/mate&lt;/pre&gt; seemed to do the trick.  Might have just been me, but it’s working now, and I’m happy.</p>

            <p><strong>Update</strong>: I was just contacted by the customer support person from yesterday, and indeed there’s an Alex and I’ve been credited in my account.  Thanks Alex.</p>
            <p>So I immediately received a comment from an “Alex” who said he was with Media Temple on my previous post.   (He actually left two comments, as they went to moderation, and sent a contact message.)  The <a href="http://miklb.com/give-the-gift-of-down-time#comment-88">comment </a> speaks for itself.  I did that, emailed him, giving the primary domain, and email address for my account.  Two days later, I get the automated emails about my credit card being declined.  Oh, right, I was mugged two weeks before Thanksgiving, and had my wallet stolen, so I had to get a new card.  But wait, weren’t they going to credit me?  I wait.  Another email.  I wait.  This time, an email with a name attached.   I respond, saying, Alex said he was going to be crediting my account.  Is there an Alex?  Was I duped?  No response at this point.  Meanwhile, I couldn’t FTP into my accounts most of yesterday because of some <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/authentication-issues-on-gs-gridcluster2/">Authentication server  problems. </a></p>
            <p>Not that I’m having the greatest success setting up the VPS server I’m testing from SliceHost.  Mostly MySQL problems.  I’m not ready to give up PHPMyAdmin just yet, nor FTP.  But that’s another post.</p>

            <p>Another six months, another disappointment in web hosting.  This time, the popular Media Temple grid-server.  For the past 2+ months, its been one problem after another, with the most recent being an 12 plus hour down time because of a <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/electrical-systems-maintenance-notice-nov-30th/">failed maintenance</a>.  They talk of credits for users, however I’m not seeing one in my account.  A company I work with received the email, however, not my personal account.  So on the heals of this debacle, they are offering <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/2007/12/04/give-the-gift-of-web-hosting/">gift  cards</a> for a years worth of hosting.  As if someone would want to give you a migraine for Christmas.</p>
            <p>Nice timing Media Temple….</p>
