<a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/09/09.html#a4871">Crooks and Liars</a> has a sound clip of OxyContin Man slipping up and calling New Orleans Mayor Nagin's, "Nayger".  They say it's intentional "flub".  I personally don't give fat boy that much credit.  But the audio on my laptop ain't that great.  Regardless, another example of his ignorant lap dog mentality.
