The same site referenced by Dick Cheney in a previous election, outlines the fact that the process of clearing judges is quicker now, than before, and the truth of the matter is, of the 46 federal judgeships vacant, Bush has only nominated 16 replacements.
Another interesting tidbit:
<blockquote>
Asked to support the ad's claim that Democrats are responsible for delays, Progress for America cited the situation in the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. And indeed, that court's median time to dispose of a case was 16.8 months in 2004, the worst record of any of the 12 appeals courts. To be sure, there are currently four vacancies on that court all considered "judicial emergencies" based on its volume of cases, according to the Administrative Office of the US Courts. Bush has nominated judges to fill all of them.

However, a closer look shows that both parties share responsibility for the 6th Circuit?s awful record. Three of those vacancies opened up during the Clinton administration, one of them as far back as 1995. But former Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham, now Bush's energy secretary, blocked two of Clinton' s nominees to that court by the simple expedient of refusing to allow hearings on them. 
</blockquote>
Just as the House backtracked on the ethics committee, at some point they are going to have to realize in the Senate that what's good for the goose, is good for the gander.
