Looks like starting tomorrow, the NY Times is handcuffing its content.  Rather, handcuffing its readers.  Times Select, they're calling it.  $40 bucks a year if you sign up by today, $50 otherwise.  Sure, some of the stuff will be free, but the good stuff, the Maureen Dowd articles, well, that'll cost you.  However, in addition to the current content, the subscription will get you access to 100 archived articles a month.  And, if you subscribe to home delivery, then it'll be free.  What to do, what to do.  (Anyone want to split a subscription?)
