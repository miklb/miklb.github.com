I've not blogged about this topic before, but I came across <strong>2</strong> newspaper articles this morning outlining major deficiencies in the system.  While in college, I wrote an argumentative paper against capital punishment, and I still stand by that stance.  I don't believe those convicted of murder should live in the lap of luxury, however I don't believe we've perfected a system to take another's life in response to murder.  <a href="http://www.columbusdispatch.com/news-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/05/03/20060503-A1-02.html">This article from the Columbus Dispatch</a> details failure in the actual lethal injection process, in which failure to establish an IV led to a prolonged process, that had to be done behind closed doors.
In this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/us/03execute.html">NY Times article</a>, short comings in the state of Texas's method of reviewing deaths by arson.  Currently in Texas, the reviews are made by people who've <em>never</em> attended any formal training in the area.  The article outlines the execution of an innocent man due to the process.  
So mistakes a plenty, no empirical evidence that the death penalty prevents murders, and mountains of tax dollars spent to litigate death penalty cases, can we end this archaic practice now?
