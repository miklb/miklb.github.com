              <p>Now to make these changes on this design (though I plan on a complete overhaul before the end of the year, so it might wait).  That said, I’m looking forward to feedback, and possibly seeing this go into the default download as another optional theme as has been suggested to me.  I’ll leave that to others to decide, but I’m certainly not against the idea one bit.</p>
