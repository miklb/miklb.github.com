<strong>Update</strong>: I was just contacted by the customer support person from yesterday, and indeed there's an Alex and I've been credited in my account.  Thanks Alex.

So I immediately received a comment from an "Alex" who said he was with Media Temple on my previous post.   (He actually left two comments, as they went to moderation, and sent a contact message.)  The <a href="http://miklb.com/give-the-gift-of-down-time#comment-88">comment </a> speaks for itself.  I did that, emailed him, giving the primary domain, and email address for my account.  Two days later, I get the automated emails about my credit card being declined.  Oh, right, I was mugged two weeks before Thanksgiving, and had my wallet stolen, so I had to get a new card.  But wait, weren't they going to credit me?  I wait.  Another email.  I wait.  This time, an email with a name attached.   I respond, saying, Alex said he was going to be crediting my account.  Is there an Alex?  Was I duped?  No response at this point.  Meanwhile, I couldn't FTP into my accounts most of yesterday because of some <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/authentication-issues-on-gs-gridcluster2/">Authentication server  problems. </a>

Not that I'm having the greatest success setting up the VPS server I'm testing from SliceHost.  Mostly MySQL problems.  I'm not ready to give up PHPMyAdmin just yet, nor FTP.  But that's another post.
