                <p>Poor, poor, Mike Brown.  He feels humiliated that he was pulled out of New Orleans.  How bloody humiliated are the people living in conditions in the hurricane stricken region?   How much money of ours has been squandered in the lack of preparation?  And to that end, is this another “falling on the sword” loyal lap dog?  At what point will the Bush administration, and Bush specifically be held responsible for appointing lap dogs like Brown.  How many deaths will it take?  Obviously more than 2000, as Iraq has proven.  But how about the 45 dead bodies that were found in the hospital today?  Were they preventable?  I wonder how they felt about the privatization of Social Security?</p>

                  has done some looking, and it appears that the Bush administration, in their back slapping of pre-hurricane state of emergency annoucement, <strong>FAILED TO MENTION THE COASTAL PARISHES!!</strong>  Check out the map Bob’s got at his site, and the link to the whitehose.gov press release.  So far, he’s found no explanation.  Good one McClellan.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050908-5.html">Proclamation</a> Apparently, there’s provisions that state the Labor Secretary sets a minumum wage to pay various levels of laborers and “mechanics”.  Well, Bush has suspended this provision.   It’s written into the provision that he can, and in some circumstances, I can understand why.  But we are talking about Bush, and Cheney, and I can see how some corporate contractors seize an opportunity to not pay laborers a federally mandated min. rate, but still charge their “normal” fees.  So prior to the Hurricane, a skilled worker in NO would have been paid a certain rate if working on a federal contract, now he will be paid less.  Good thing those tax cuts went to those who needed it most…</p>

                <p>So I started the WordPress “fan” site recently, <a href="http://wpstation.com">WordPress Station</a>, and recently got it its own domain.  And while surfing around, I found an open source design that was a hack of Apple’s brushed metal design.  There was a brushed metal theme for WP when I first started using it, but it’s disappeared.  Not sure why, but I figured there might be a few who’d want to give it a run.  Therefore, I’m in the process of porting it to WP, and have it in “beta” over at WPstation.  Plus, I’ve been busy working with an upstart hosting company, and will begin offering a great deal on a basic hosting package VERY soon.
Now if I could only motivate myself to post over at cookingwith more…</p>
