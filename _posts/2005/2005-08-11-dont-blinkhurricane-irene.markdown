Don't Blink, don't turn away, but the latest <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at200509_model.html">computer model</a> has Irene turning back to the SW and heading towards good ol' FLA.  Not that you will see that in the National Hurricane Center forcast until the other models pickup on it, but, after last year, I don't take anything for granted.
Check the lantern for mantles kiddies, 'tis the season.
