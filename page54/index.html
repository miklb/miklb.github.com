                <p>So I downloaded the bleeding edge version of Firefox, code name bon echo, to poke around a bit.  Seemed a little snappier, but could have been because 98% of the plugins were disabled.  Turn it off, open my regular firefox, and without asking me, it upgraded to 1.5.0.3.  Bullshit, I say.  I don’t want the latest version, if simply for the fact that the reason I use FireFox is the extensions.  And this version, the extensions I rely on, are now disabled.  So I might as well use Safari.  I like to wait until the extensions catch up with the release.  And I’m not at all happy with the new RSS icon in the address bar.  This really was a bad move, and I’m not sure how it happened.  A really bad taste, that’s for sure.</p>
                <p><strong>Update</strong> So I’m guessing they realized that 1.5.0.3 was borked, because 1.5.0.4 is now out, and my extensions work now.  In the meantime, I checked out <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>, a Mac mozilla based browser, and may just well use that for everyday browsing.  I don’t like the idea of using more than one, but now that I have <a href="http://miklb.com/scuttle/">Scuttle</a> set up on my site, (I used delicious, but don’t like the idea of Yahoo controlling my bookmarks), bookmarking isn’t as big an issue with the 2 browser set up.  Camino is faster, FF offers extensions that make working on web sites invaluable.  So I may just become a 2 broswer guy.</p>

                  I’m not the biggest fan of Pelosi, but I applaud the token letter she sent out.  So often one side criticizes another, yet fails to follow their own marching orders.  She’s putting the Democratic Party’s money where their mouth is.  While well heeled Republicans like the likes of Ney and DeLay held their posts well after annouced charges, with a ground swell of support from the White House down, the Dem’s are doing what is right.  Step aside, and let the courts sort it out.  Do the right thing.<br />

                <p><a href="http://www.jesseslife.com/">jesseslife.com</a>A guy dropping out of the hustle and bustle, visiting all of the national parks our great country (yes, despite wiretapping, FBI raids on congressman’s offices, and the like, I still think it’s a great country) has to offer.  Beautiful pictures, and great insight.  He seems to be about half way through the parks, so I’m looking forward to the rest of his journey.  I’ve not been to quite as many parks as he, but reading his ventures through Rocky Mountain National Park and Badlands stirred memories of a younger, more bright-eyed miklb driving cross the the plains of North Dakota and Wyoming, down into Denver.  Having grown up with the natural beauty of Florida, the northern plains and the Rocky Mountains were another world.<br />
                  I’m looking forward to the rest of Jesse’s adventure, and wish him the best in his sojourn.</p>

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>There has been much buzz the past week regarding comment/trackback spam around the net.  Discussions regarding a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/16/AR2006051601873.html">cyber spam war</a>, threads all over the WP support forums, and blog post after blog post regarding spam.  Meanwhile, I sit wondering am I missing out on something?  Do the spammers simply not like me?  I’ve gotten one or two Spam Karma digests, with a few caught spams over the past week, but nothing like the “100s” of spams I’ve seen people mention.  I didn’t think I was doing anything exceptional to protect against spam.  I’m running <a href="http://www.homelandstupidity.us/software/bad-behavior/">Bad Behavior</a> and <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/">Spam Karma 2</a>.  No Akismet, the golden child of WP lead developer Matt Mullenweg, no captchas, nothing else.<br />
                  Then I wonder, is it because I’ve donated to both plugin developers, that I really do have Spam Karma on my side?  Either way, know if and when I get an adsense deposit, that a portion of it will go again to both plugin developers, just in case ;-)</p>

                  I’m not quite sure what to make of this, but I have to agree, the substitute driver should have had better training in how to handle riders that seem not to be students.  However, I can also understand the level of concern, and truthfully feel the authorities are handling this in the proper manner.  I don’t care if they are Saudi or not, two adults boarding a high school bus, and not showing complete remorse when told of what they’ve done requires further investigation.  I’m not a fan of racial profiling to say the least , however, in today’s climate, all precaution should be taken.  And as I said, any adult not showing remorse sends a signal to me.  You have to think the driver and students were on the edge of their seat the whole ride, and were happy to see  swarm of police when they arrived at school.  What I hope not to see is a rash of law suits from well to do parents claiming negligence on the drivers part.  That will accomplish nothing, but strap an already over burden school system with legal fees and potentially worse.</p>
                <p>Clearly something needs to be clarified about how to handle similar situations, and at least in this area, better training and incentives for drivers need to be in place, as anytime something “scary” or worse happens, its a substitute driver at the wheel.</p>
