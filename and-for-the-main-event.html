    <meta name="description" content="In case you missed it, Katrina Vanden Hueval and Ann Coulter were part of Larry King’s panel discussing the DeLay indictment. However, the difference is those two were in the studio with King, whereas the others where off-studio cameras.  As usual, Coulter had to try and get the last word, wouldn’t answer King’s questions (I’ll give it to the old softy, he sorta tried to ask the hard questions), and basically came across as her lunatic self.  Vanden Hueval surprised me when she even joined the mantra of “culture of corruption”.  Ultimately, it was a matter of two diametrically opposed political commentators, and nothing new was added.  But at times, it looked like there could be a cat fight." />
