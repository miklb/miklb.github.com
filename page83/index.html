    <p>As if our country doesn’t have enough on its plate, it is being reported Chief Justice Rehnquist died today.  So we are still arguing the merits of Roberts (to no avail), and now the discussion of which ultra-right wing judge will move up to replace Scalia, as he moves to Chief Justice.  Unless Bush pulls the PR move and names Sandra Day O’Conner, he has found the perfect distraction from his debacle in the delta.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/briefroom/BriefRm">Census Economic Briefing Rooms</a>Hmm.  Household income stagnat in real dollars, poverty up, uninsured Americans, up, homeownership down a percent, yeah, sounds about time to take a vacation.  If my fellow Americans do not put this Administration and those that have supported it on a very long vacation starting next year, I’m gonna start pricing guns and land in Montana…anyone else in?</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.nola.com/hurricane/?/washingaway/">NOLA.com: Hurricane Center</a>Don’t ask me why, but when looking at national news, I clicked on the bookmark for the Times Picayune…A front page void of news, with some prexisting links still there, I found this 5 part series link at the bottom of the page.&lt;blockquote&gt; “A catastrophic hurricane represents 10 or 15 atomic bombs in terms of the energy it releases,” said Joseph Suhayda, a Louisiana State University engineer who is studying ways to limit hurricane damage in the New Orleans area.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

    <p>Potentially one of the worst natural disasters in the last 25 years, a breakdown in the Iraqi constitution, soaring crude oil prices, and where’s George?  Hunkering down in Mississippi?  No.  Meeting with experts on alternative energy? NO.  Bringing together representatives of the Sunni and Shiite factions to work out a compromise? Hell no.  He’s sitting with a bunch of retirees in Sun City stroking them about the advantages of privatized Social Security.  Oh, sure, you say, “he did tell the folks in Lousiana and Mississippi that the country would pray for them.  You know, on second thought, go back to Crawford George, and take the rest of the year off.</p>
