Alright, so I'm slowly piecing toghether a sidebar that I'm happy with.  Now to learn som CSS (lucky for me, that's where we are at in my HTML class), so I'll have a tutorial in the basics.)  What I want to do is slightly shift things to the right, and give bullets of some sort to the links under each link category.  Right now, everything is an ul, so if I put the list type to a bullet, EVERYTHING gets a bullet, and even then, they show up to far left of the column.  I will figure it out.  But if anyone stumbles along this site and can offer a suggestion, I'm all ears.

<b><del>And I still want to change the header image</del></b>
