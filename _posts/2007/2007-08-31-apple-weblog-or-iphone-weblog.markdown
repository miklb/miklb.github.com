Can someone please tell <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/">The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> to start a new iPhone blog, and leave my feedreader free of half a dozen or more posts everyday about the iPhone?  I appreciate the need for constant updating, but certainly, you don't have to post everytime someone who owns an iPhone coughs.
