    <p>I’ve been a home owner for a little over 5 years, and for the most part, haven’t thought twice about the decision.  That is, until the toilet acts up.  That damn thing has been nothing short of the proverbial thorn in my side from day one.  Leaking, not flushing, overfilling, you name it, I’ve dealt with it.  And being the “manly man” that I am, I’ve done all the repairs myself, even when I’ve made huge mistakes like chipping the tank where the fill valve seats, and having to hunt down some kind of epoxy/resin to fill in the chips so the tank would fill and not leak.<br />
No matter how many times I’ve replaced the ballcock, refill valve, handle, lever, 3 months later this thing stops working properly.  I feel like I’m a Marine with an M16 when it comes to the thing.  I could take it apart and put it back together blindfolded.  Today wasn’t <em>too</em> bad, I had to take the ballcock apart, and clean a little gasket inside, reseat it, and adjust the lever to allow the float to rise.
So set the timer, by August, something will <strong>have</strong> to be replace.</p>

    <p>I’ve updated my <a href="http://www.miklb.com/rss">RSS reader</a>, <a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarius</a>, to the latest SVN.  Which means the latest code.  Not always a great idea, but this version has been in development for some time, and about to be released as .5.4.  I’d like to thank <a href="http://kalsey.com/2006/03/gregarius/">Adam Kalsey</a> for his help via IRC, and for his theme.  I really want to look closer at the the theme system, I really think it’s similar to WordPress’s system.  Adam’s theme is definitely an improvement in a lot of ways over the default theme, but I’d like to maybe soften it up a bit.  For some reason, my eyes just don’t work with the grays.  Especially the header image.
While I’m on the subject, I was checking out Dave Winer’s <a href="http://share.opml.org/">Share your OPML</a>.  I haven’t added my OPML <em>yet</em>, but I did discover Mark Cuban’s <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/">Blog Maverick</a>.  I’m not a big basketball fan, but of all the interviews I’ve seen/read, I’ve found him interesting.  Reading his posts left me with a similar feeling.  I’ve always secretly wished he would buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from the Glazers.  Who knows.  Anyway, I’m off to the OPML site to find more feeds for my reading pleasure.</p>

    <p>I’ve not blogged about this topic before, but I came across <strong>2</strong> newspaper articles this morning outlining major deficiencies in the system.  While in college, I wrote an argumentative paper against capital punishment, and I still stand by that stance.  I don’t believe those convicted of murder should live in the lap of luxury, however I don’t believe we’ve perfected a system to take another’s life in response to murder.  <a href="http://www.columbusdispatch.com/news-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/05/03/20060503-A1-02.html">This article from the Columbus Dispatch</a> details failure in the actual lethal injection process, in which failure to establish an IV led to a prolonged process, that had to be done behind closed doors.
In this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/us/03execute.html">NY Times article</a>, short comings in the state of Texas’s method of reviewing deaths by arson.  Currently in Texas, the reviews are made by people who’ve <em>never</em> attended any formal training in the area.  The article outlines the execution of an innocent man due to the process.<br />
So mistakes a plenty, no empirical evidence that the death penalty prevents murders, and mountains of tax dollars spent to litigate death penalty cases, can we end this archaic practice now?</p>

        Thumbnails on Home Page
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2006-05-01T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">01 May 2006</time>

    <p>This little tutorial is intended as a means of providing WordPress users the means of posting a thumbnail image on their home page, and having a full size image on the single page view.  This is accomplished using the image uploader built into WordPress, and CSS.  If you are intending on using excerpts on the home page, then the addition of Kaf’s <a href="http://guff.szub.net/2005/02/26/the-excerpt-reloaded/">Excerpt Reloaded</a> plugin.  His plugin allows for the inclusion of tags within the excerpt, something the built in function the_excerpt does not.
The first step is to make sure you have the_content or the_excerpt wrapped in a unique div class.  I’m not sure of the exact correct semantics, but I simply call my home page excerpt   “home”, and single page div “single”. (Note, depending on your theme, you may or may not need to create a separate class for the single page view.  I actually wound up not using single in my theme, as I was able to use the class “primary” from the original code.  The objective is to have a parent div to call with the specific class we assign the thumbnail).
Next, when you upload your images via the WP upload, be sure to note the path.  Generally speaking, both the created thumbnail and full size image are placed in the same directory.  the difference being the thumbnail file is yourimage.thumbnail.jpg.  So now that you have uploaded the image, and the thumbnail has been created, it’s time to place both the thumbnail and full size image in your post.  We are going to code the image directly, and not use the WYSIWYG or quick tag buttons, as we need to add a class directly to the image.  Again, not sure about proper semantics, but I used “big” and small, obviously for the full size and thumbnail, respectively.  Note, if you want to also float the image, you can use two classes, simply leave a space between each class.  An example would look something like this :
<code>&lt;img class="left small" src="http://yourblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/image.thumbnail.jpg alt="image" /&gt;<img class="left big" src="http://yourblog/com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/image.jpg" alt="image" /></code>
Now to create the CSS to hide images on the different pages.
First, to hide the full size image on the main page, we need to add to our style sheet .home .big {display: none}.<br />
Then to hide the thumbnail on the single page view, we add .single .small {display: none}.
That’s it.  A couple of simple CSS classes and the built in image upload.  A note about the code.  Depending on your theme, you may or may not need to create a few more templates.  If your theme only has an index.php file, then you’ll need to save a copy of that as single.php then make the changes to that, as outlined.  <br />
I’d love some feedback on the semantics of the classes, as that’s still an area I’m learning about, as well as any general feedback about the concept.  It works fine for the theme structure I’m using, but if you run into any problems with your theme, please leave a comment, and I’ll do my best to help you make it work.</p>
