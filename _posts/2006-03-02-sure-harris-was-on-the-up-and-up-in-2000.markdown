<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/images/harris.gif" alt="harris" />The argument has been made over and over to defend the clown woman for her actions in handling the Election in 2000, and the events leading up to it (see Texas company hired to purge thousands of "felons" from voter roll, etc).  Now she's seen clearly in bed with an admitted criminal who's been found to illegally donate to her campaign, she's been documented to have worked with/campaigned with/for ol' Duke Cunningham, who's admitted to taking kick backs/bribes.  If it looks like a circus clown, and talks like a circus clown...nah, that's not fair to the memory of Emmitt Kelly.
My only worry is that she won't run this fall, and Bill Nelson will actually have to campaign against someone.
