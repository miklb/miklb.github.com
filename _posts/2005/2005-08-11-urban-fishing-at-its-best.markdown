Ahh.  Red tide, heat indexes of 105ยบ +, rising housing costs, traffic, Jeb Bush...all reasons to hate living in Florida, and Tampa in particular.  But this morning, I walked for three hours in waist deep water, watching aquatic life teeming around me, all the while with the "twin cities" of Tampa and St. Petersburg bookending my morning.  
Granted, I misapplied my sunscreen, thus I have splotchy red spots, and my fishing partner took home the grand prize of a 24 inch red (drum) fish, however, my world sorta slipped back onto its axis, as I maintained my realization that 5am drunken rooftop parties are no longer for me.
 Drop me a contact if you live in the Tampa Bay area and would like to experience the splendor that is Florida land based fishing.
