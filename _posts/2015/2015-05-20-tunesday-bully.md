This band just rocks me. I can not wait for the whole record. God knows what bands they listen to.

Steve Albini, do your homework.

Pixies? Sure.

 Nirvana? Had to.

Bands I missed out when I was doing stuff? I want to know them too.

Please, more music like this.

That bass line. Be still the 23 year old still in my heart.
