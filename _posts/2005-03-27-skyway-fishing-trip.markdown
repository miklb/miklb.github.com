So yesterday I got out to experience the "spring run" of Spanish Mackeral at the old Skyway bridge, now refered to as a fishing pier.  Fortunately I was there early, way early, so I had a prime spot, and on the button at 6am I had line in the water, and by 6:05 am I had my first fish.  I easily could have simply filled the bucket by 8, but I was trying for some larger fish.  The big ones didn't seem quite as interested in my choice of spoons.  Regardless, it was a wonderful day, I learned more about fishing for this species, and look forward to getting out again soon.
