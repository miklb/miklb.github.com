                  Trying to catch up on the news after working 35+ hours in 3 days is tough, but this article caught my interest.  Seems the Bush administration has appointed someone who is actually listening, and taking action in preserving our national parks.  I strongly believe the parks should be restricted in the use of motorized vehicles, for many reasons.  I can only hope the draft is taken as it stands, and I intend on adding my comments formally, as there’s a 90 day window to do so.  I’ll update after I make my voice heard.</p>

                  So a supervisor of elections uncovers more security issues with electronic voting machines, and our elected leader’s answer is to pass a bill preventing independent testing of the equipment.  Real bloody smart.  I’m all for technological advancements in all areas of government, but I also want to know that the technology is secure.  Which means testing, and more testing.  Rather than a knee jerk reaction and getting into bed with a company because of questionable lobbying practices, or the like.  I really hope this bill has limited support, and state reps shoot this down quickly.</p>

                  Mark Cuban, blogger and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is blogging the NBA finals.  I have to say, his blogging has made it infectious to be a Mav’s fan for the finals.  I’m not really a basketball fan, but have a few friends who’ve been watching the playoffs, so I’ve followed along.  I also came across Mark Cuban’s blog while checking out some feeds while investigating over at <a href="http://share.opml.org">Share Your OPML</a> as the playoffs started.  So I’ve been following his blogs while keeping an eye to the playoffs.  It’s fun to see things transpire as they have.</p>

                <p>On the heels of 6.6.06, I find this little web site that calculates your estimated time of death based on a series of questions.  Not the cheery thing, but perhaps a little reality to snap us back into a healthier lifestyle is what we need.</p>
