            <p>So quickly I’ve discovered (or been reminded), that using a Mail.app rule to move right out of the Inbox removes the notice in the dock.  Not a big deal, but if I’m away from the computer when the hour is up, I might not see that I have new work email, so I’ve employed <a href="http://www.tonyallevato.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=29">Mail Badger</a>, so that I can create a custom icon notice in the Mail icon in the dock just for that work’s email.  So far so good though with the system.</p>

            <p>It seems that Technorati finally was able to index the site, as well as fix the issue with the site regarding new claims for sites not supported with the their quick claim.  Not sure why I was actually waiting for the claim before blogging more here, but it worked out, as I was out with a medical issue the past few weeks, so timing is everything.  I really look forward to blogging, and now I have no excuses.</p>

            <p>Seems Habari can’t use Technorati’s quick claim process, so I was asked to paste a little code in a post, so the claim process could proceed.  Hopefully this will be quick.  I will say that Lev with Technorati was very nice and apologetic regarding the issue, and offered any more assistance necessary.</p>

            <p>I just got my invite for the alpha testing (yes, alpha, not beta) of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>, and I can say with certainty that I love it, and am ready to buy it now.  It just seems to be intuitive enough with just the right amount of features (and it’s not done).  I certainly hope that the main interface doesn’t get clogged up like many other GTD apps have done trying to be too many things to too many people.  I especially like that you can group projects.  I’ll blog more once I’ve really had a chance to dig into it a bit more, but if you are Mac using GTD’er, you really should <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/listinfo/omnifocus-beta-announce">sign up for the beta-announcement list</a>, especially if you are not happy with the other options out there.</p>
