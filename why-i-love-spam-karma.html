    <meta name="description" content="…and will be hitting Dr Dave’s PayPal later today.  The last couple of days, I had noticed I was getting S P A M emails, that seemed legit.  But further investigation, revealed that it was bunk.  First giveaway  was the “Great Site”, but the kicker would be a fishing site commenting on a fishing article.  They are searching technorait, or google blog search, and finding keywords and then hitting.  So, some what frustrated, I delete, and wonder if Bad Behavior and Spam Karma are working.  Low and behold I go to delete some more via SK, and I’m greeted by a message saying it’s not just me with spam getting through, and offering up some solutions, with an assurance that there are more tricks to SK to squash the recent wave of Spammers if it persists.  Well worth a trip to Dr. Dave’s site and donate what ever you can, be it a month’s intake of Google Ads, or $10, or more, if you can spare it.  I’ve already done so with Bad Behavior, and so should you, especially if you spend any where the time I’ve spent the last two days cleaning 3 blogs of spam.  The donation is well worth the time it would save." />
