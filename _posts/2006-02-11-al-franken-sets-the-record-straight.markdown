<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-franken/reflections-on-the-wellst_b_15459.html?">Al Franken over at HuffPo</a> sets the record straight regarding the Wellstone Memorial, especially in comparison to the King Service.  A point he touches on, that the conservative pundits have failed to, regarding Carter's comments, is that Carter knew Coretta Scott King.  Recently, while watching Carter on Larry King, he remarked that he probably wouldn't have been president had it not been for King.  He said she campaigned strongly for him in '76.  It just burns the Republicans that he's still out there in the world, making things happen, and they're busy putting out Abramhoff and Libby fires.
