        <p>I’ve recently been using Safari 4 beta, mostly because I had been too lazy to get more RAM, and Firefox was just too damn slow with all the apps I’d have open on only 1 gig.  Now that I’m at 4 gigs, I’ve been contemplating going back to Firefox, especially with the comments I’ve been reading about the speed improvements of the next version (3.5??).  Another reason I’ve been contemplating going back to Firefox is that Firebug is just far superior to Safari’s built in inspector.  To that end, I’ve recently come across two add-ons for Firebug.</p>

<p>The first, <a href="http://robertnyman.com/firefinder/">Firefinder</a>, is a handy tool to “find HTML elements matching chosen CSS selector(s) or XPath expression”.</p>

<p>The second is one that <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/06/introducing-page-speed.html">Google previously used internally</a>.  Today they open sourced it and released, <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/">Page Speed</a>.  Page Speed allows developers to “evaluate the performance of their web pages and to get suggestions on how to improve them.”</p>

<strong><em>This is just a quick and dirty post announcing the release. I hope to publish a more detailed post on the Habari blog detailing more about the the theme and it’s use of HiEngine.</em></strong>
It’s been a long time in coming, but I’m happy to report that I’ve finally released a new theme, thePrestige.  Built entirely with Habari’s <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/HiEngine">HiEngine</a> theme engine, the first publicly released (at least to my knowledge.)  Many thanks to <a href="http://www.cockrumpublishing.com/">Rick Cockrum</a> for doing the heavy lifting on the Hiengine code.</p>

<p>Consider this a <em>“beta”</em> release, as there probably are a few bugs/quirks that need to be worked out, but for all intents and purposes, it’s fully functional.  Any bug reports or feature requests should be logged at the <a href="http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras">Habari Extra’s</a> trac installation.  Patches certainly welcome!</p>

<p>The theme also features a contact form completely built with Habari’s formUI, as well as uses the jquery <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/">tooltip plugin.</a>.</p>

<p>One “feature” that I intend to finish up is post author comment highlighting.  That is, styling the post author’s comments differently than the rest of the comments on a post.  The code is in place, just needs some CSS love.  Again, patches welcome!</p>

<p>The theme has only been tested on the latest 0.7 build of trunk, I will work on making a version that works with 0.6.2.  Again, assistance welcome on this task.  I think the only glaring issue right now would be the use of the jquery tooltip for the comment form.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.habariproject.org/dist/themes/thePrestige.zip">Download the theme</a> from Habari Extras.</p>

<p>Or you can check it out from the repo at http://svn.habariproject.org/extras/themes/thePrestige/trunk/.</p>

        <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/chicken_scratch.png" alt="handwriting font" class="right" />How cool is this?</p>

<p>Poking around the web this evening, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.yourfonts.com/">Your Fonts</a>, a <strong>FREE!!!</strong> web based font generator.  The process is pretty straight forward.  You download the two page template (the second page is optional), and write your characters in the corresponding boxes.  They recommend using a fine tip permanent marker.  I used a fine point Sharpie, though I think a super-fine point might be better, especially if you have poor penmanship like myself.  Once you fill in all the characters—there’s even a box for your signature, which corresponds to the carat (shift-6 on most keyboards), you scan the page and upload it via their web interface.  The fonts were generated quite quickly (though I do have a pretty fast upload speed), ~1 minute later, and I was able to download the font.</p>

<p>You get the option of naming the font, as well as adding your name to the copyright.  Reading through their <a href="http://www.yourfonts.com/help.html">FAQ</a>, you retain full ownership of the generated font, including the freedom to share or sell the font.</p>

<p>I would recommend reading through all of the steps before uploading, including printing a second copy to practice.  My first attempt I didn’t pay attention to the guides, and the bottom of a few of the characters were cut off.</p>

<p>The possibilities of this service are endless.  I don’t see why one couldn’t use the second, optional page for creating your own custom dingbats.  I could also see it being a quite novel thing if you had children to have them write out their alphabet and save it for posterity.  Any family member for that matter.  Imagine having your parent’s or grandparent’s handwriting archived.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought it was a super cool discovery, and well worth sharing.  If you create your own, I’d love to see it.</p>

        <h4><strong>Updated!</strong></h4>
<p>I inadvertently forgot to remove tracking code from the footer from when the theme was deployed on my previous site, so I’m removing the old download link and updating the release.  Apologies to anyone who’s already downloaded the theme, you can download the updated version (0.3.1), which also has <code>$theme-&gt;footer();</code> added, which can be a useful plugin hook.</p>

<p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/aqueous_ss.png" class="right" alt="Aqueous screen shot" />I’m proud to release my fourth Habari theme, the third port, Aqueous.  Based on an open source design by <a href="http://www.sixshootermedia.com/">Six Shooter Media</a>, this 3 column theme sports a fluid width middle column.  The original icons have been redone with custom icons that I created so there’s no issue with redistribution.  I also have restyled the comments and comment form from the original design, as well as a few other modifications for a working blog, but it still maintains the original integrity of the design, which I’ve always liked.  It has that clean, modern feel to it, despite being several years old now.</p>

<p>I had originally ported this theme for a personal site when I first switched over to Habari, and have just never gotten around to releasing it.  Now that I’m not using that site, it seemed only logical to make it available to other Habari users, especially with the lack of themes in the community.  I hope that changes sooner than later, hopefully after .6 gets released and .7 starts focusing more on the theme engine.  I’m curious to see what people have in mind for it, but that’s for another blog post.</p>

<p>I’m releasing this as an alpha release, because I really haven’t tested it in other browsers aside from Safari 4beta, but wanted to get it out and see if there was any real interest before putting too much more time into it.</p>

<p>One idea that I have for future a release is author comment styling, as it currently styles the comments all the same.  Again, this will happen if I see that’s there is actually any interest in the theme.</p>

<p>The original design was released under a Creative Commons license, so there’s no chance of the theme moving to the Habari extras repository, so any comments, bugs, feature requests should be left in the comments on this post.  Future posts about releases will direct comments to this post.  There’s nothing worse than a site having comments scattered about the same theme/plugin.</p>

<p>First up, Swanky.  Not that I’ve seen anyone use this theme, but I did use it as a base for my <a href="http://cookingwith.miklb.com">cooking blog</a>, so it behooves me to have some updated code to make sure I’m using the latest and greatest Habari.  I’m not quite sure no one has (to my knowledge) used or modified the theme, perhaps the pink and black and <em>sexy silhouette</em> isn’t a big draw.  But as I’ve pointed out, it can be a great starting point for modification.  Maybe I’m just not aware, and there are scores of sites using it…then again, since I haven’t released a new version in quite some time, that could be a factor as well.  Today, that is fixed.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, this update is in anticipation of the impending 0.6 release, so unless you are running from svn, or a <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/download">nightly snapshot</a>, this version probably won’t work.  For an overview of the theme, see the <a href="http://miklb.com/swanky-theme">original post</a>.</p>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed calls to jquery and and a deprecated Stack::out call</li>
<li>Properly calling $theme-&gt;tag rather than using the potentially exploitable Controller::get_var function</li>
<li>updated the calls to check for logged in and added a tab to the top navigation for logged in users to admin</li>
<li>fixing a CSS bug on long post titles so they don't cover the timestamp</li>
</ul>

<p>This is considered a beta release, any bugs or changes will be addressed before the final release of Habari 0.6.</p>
