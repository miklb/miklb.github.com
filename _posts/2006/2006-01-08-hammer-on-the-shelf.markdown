Now that he's made more mainstream news cycles, I've refrained from posting much on the Hammer.  But I feel this news is worthy of a shout from the cliff, as it signals to me the pressure from within the party is doing exactly what I said they would do...use him up and throw him on hte scrap heap.  He will probably lose his primary in March, as I'd guess the republican machine will throw their money behind his competitor, hoping he'll have a better chance against a democrat in the fall.  From there, he can be a fall guy for the Abramhoff deal, along with Ney, probably taking a bullet or two for several other republicans.  So this story is FAR from over, and the dominos have yet to get primary players, but one can only hope the truth <em>mostly</em> comes out.
