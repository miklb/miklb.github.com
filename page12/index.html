        <p><strong>Update:</strong> The plot thickens.  <a href="http://seancoates.com">Sean Coates</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/coates/status/47642561044680706">pointed out on Twitter this morning</a> that the Twitter API announcement has been pulled, with no obvious response.  Most of the mailing list message is still available in an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/mar/14/twitter-developers-client-warning">article in the Guardian</a>.</p>

<p>First, I’m not a developer of software.  I make websites. I use Twitter. A lot sometimes. <img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/dead_bird_twitter.jpg" class="right" alt="" />  I have found the reaction to Twitter’s curious <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a">announcement in the change in their terms of service</a> interesting.  Granted, most reactions I have read are from developer types, so it may be biased.  The sentiment  could be summed up in a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GlennF/status/46442047980310528">tweet I saw today</a>, “Twitter: from #dickbar to #dickmove”. That basically Twitter added a new “feature” in their most recent mobile app that absolutely no one liked and users were abuzz with suggestions for other clients.  Rather than listen to these users (granted, they did release a minor update that apparently mitigates to a degree the trending bar, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/06/dickbar">coined by Gruber</a> the <em>dickbar</em>) they simply decided to post to a mailing list telling developers to not plan on being able to create alternate clients.  Poor timing? Possibly. They very well could have been planning this announcement for some time.  Still seems odd.</p>

<p><span class="pquote-l">But what if they had challenged themselves internally? </span>  “We are going to make such a kick ass experience for the desktop, mobile and web, users won’t bother with these imitators.”  They could have looked at who was doing great things with the iPhone and the desktop and simply hired them to make their product better.  Listened to their users to see what features these other clients were offering and <strong>make them better</strong>.  Isn’t that what free-market competition should be all about? Not, “hey, thanks for helping build up our user base, now go screw yourselves.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, Twitter really reminded me that I don’t pay for it, so I can’t really bitch about it, and should remember my goal of <a href="http://miklb.com/less-twitter-more-me">Less Twitter, more me.</a>.</p>

        <p>While revisiting the Avett Bros tonight in my music library, the next band was Archers of Loaf, which got me to thinking what was Eric Bachmann’s subsequent project up to?  So I Googled them and discovered they’re going to be in Tampa February 26.</p>

<p>One of the seminal shows I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing in Ybor City (or any where for that matter) was a Crooked Fingers show at the New World Brewery.  It was one of the coldest nights, particularly that late in winter I’ve ever known. Due to some circumstances beyond my understanding, they <strong>had to</strong> play New World, and because of the cold, had to play inside.  One thing led to another, sound issues, I don’t know, but the band played, literally, on the bar unplugged.  Mind you, there might have been 50 people tops in the place that night, but if you ask anyone now, they were there.  I mean, if you’ve ever been inside that bar, it’s not big.  They were <strong>standing on the bar</strong>, moving from as you enter counter clock-wise until they finished up the set in front of the jukebox.  If the cliché “epic” could better be applied, I’m not sure where.</p>

<p>I’ve gathered more of their music over the years, still find myself listening to the Archers of Loaf’s <cite>All the Nation’s Airports</cite> and am stoked to see a where a serious song writer’s taken his craft.</p>

        <p>I like to pride myself on knowing this little country of the USA pretty well.  I’ve driven back and forth, up and down, and just about everywhere in between.  I would have thought I knew every town that an airline like Southwest Air would service.  That is until today.  The “ding” alert was for Harlingen.  Not only did I not know where that was, I hadn’t even ever heard of the town.  But thankfully to the power of Google, I now know it’s a border town in SE Texas. South of both Corpus Christ and San Antonio.</p>
<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Harlingen&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Harlingen,+Cameron,+Texas&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.644606,-97.844238&amp;spn=6.809598,9.338379&amp;z=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;output=embed"></iframe>
<p><br /><small><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Harlingen&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Harlingen,+Cameron,+Texas&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.644606,-97.844238&amp;spn=6.809598,9.338379&amp;z=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map</a></small></p>

<p>I’m guessing then that SW Air is offering cheap flights to a border town of Mexico because there’s a stampede of people looking to tempt fate and head into Monterrey to dodge banditos for some cheap black market Viagra.  (Actually, I’m guessing it’s really for spring breakers heading to South Padre Island.)</p>

        <p>For those of you watching the Grammy’s (or just following along on Twitter) and not familiar with Arcade Fire, winner of the Grammy for best album (not to be confused with “record”) of the year, I give you the song that sold me off their first major <em>recording</em>.</p>

<p>Also, I’d like to note and ask, I’m pretty sure it wasn’t planned they’d play another song to close out the show, and the quote from the lead singer after winning, “We’re going to play another song because we <strong>like</strong> music,” was one of the best digs at the Grammy’s I’ve heard.</p>
