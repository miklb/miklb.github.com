Nothing like a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/habari/">new blog engine</a> to get the blood pumping.  Not that I'm jumping ship, just looking to broaden horizons, and see what new and exciting might be around the corner.  I'm a big fan of a couple of people involved, not such a fan of a few others.  But that's part of community.  But really I'm just testing out the <a href="http://habari.bishopblogworks.com/laymans-guide-to-installing-on-a-small-orange">trackback feature</a> on the most recent build.  So really, just ignore this post...
