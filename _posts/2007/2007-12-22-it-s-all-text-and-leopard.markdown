I recently had upgraded to Leopard, and one FireFox extension I've come to count on was <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125">It's All Text!</a>.  Which allows you to chose a text editor of your choice to edit text fields.  Sometimes I need to do some code changes for sites in a text box, or work with a large amount of text, and it was quite handy to simply edit with TextMate.  It seemed to have broken in Leopard.  I checked the settings, and changing the path to <pre>/usr/bin/mate</pre> from <pre>/usr/local/bin/mate</pre> seemed to do the trick.  Might have just been me, but it's working now, and I'm happy.
