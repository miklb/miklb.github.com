                      <p>Last night I switched over the <em>theme</em> for this site to a project I’ve been working on the last moth or so, <a href="https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb">Jekyll-IndieWeb</a>. While I have different design ideas, until I find other users interested in using it, I knew I needed to work out any kinks. I also wanted to have better microformat support until the design changes. Thus
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a>.</p>
                      <p>I will write more about the project once I have more documentation (and work out any more said kinks), but the gist is I wanted to provide someone new to Jekyll with a desire to be part of the
                        <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/">IndieWeb</a> a solid starting point. I rely heavily on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file for options a user can set - profile pic, social media links, choice to include display of webmentions - to quickly get a personal site up and running. The biggest hurdle for me was providing a minimal design that was unopinionated yet still aesthetically appealing. Anyone familiar with HTML &amp; CSS can easily build upon or modify it, but if not, it shouldn’t look <em>ugly</em>.</p>
                      <p>This has been the first solo project I’ve embarked on that was meant for public consumption from the start, which in itself has been a learning process. Now I just hope others can find it useful in some way. If the project interests you I encourage you to try it out, open any issues in the repo, or reach out on #indiewebcamp IRC, I tend to hang around there most days.</p>

                      <p>I had been plagued by an issue on my Macbook Air the last couple of months where iTunes would relaunch mysteriously. Not random relaunch mysteriously, more like, as soon as I quit, it would relaunch. I tried force quit and restarts. I trashed cache files and rebuilt the library to no avail. I filed bug reports and feedback to iTunes. Finally I reached out to @AppleSupport on Twitter. Right after (mind you, I DM’ed the account as they asked and so far no further reply) my internet friend <a href="https://twitter.com/shep">@shep</a> linked to a blog post of his from 4 years ago with his own <a href="https://iamshep.net/2012/08/the-never-ending-saga-of-itunes-launching-itself/">saga of iTunes relaunching</a>. I read through, and while I didn’t have headphones plugged in, I have dozed off a few times with my headphones in, and maybe, as he read about the microswitch in the jack, maybe, just maybe the headphones pulled out slightly &amp; not depressing said microswitch. So I forcefully inserted some headphones and quickly pulled the plug out of the jack. I quit iTunes and <em>so far</em>, iTunes hasn’t relaunched.</p>
                      <p>Did I mention @AppleSupport hasn’t followed up yet?</p>

                    <div class="e-content">
                      <p>I had an interest to learn the programming language python for quite some time. I’ve played around with it a little using <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista/id528579881?at=10lKmy">Pythonista</a> in iOS to <a href="https://miklb.com/use-pythonista-to-get-weather-of-current-location-into-drafts-app">build a fishing log</a>, but otherwise have only done some cursory reading. Since I do best learning by doing, I needed an idea to <strong>use</strong> python. I’ve seen some interesting Twitterbots built with it, <a href="https://twitter.com/pomological">@pomological</a> being my recent favorite, but wasn’t sure what to build. Ultimately, the idea came to me to build a bot that retrieves an image from Flickr and builds a color scheme from that and post the scheme and original image. I’ve done some basic research and found some libraries to connect (you didn’t think I was going to write the whole thing from scratch?).</p>
                      <p>But I don’t just want a any random image, so once I get the bot <em>working</em>, I want to be able to try and pull outdoor/landscape images. In a perfect world, I would post 3 images a day—morning, noon, and night. The morning image would be a sunrise, noon/daytime image a normal image and, you guessed it, the night/evening image would be a sunset.</p>
                      <p>I figured I needed a name for the Twitterbot, not only to make sure something would be available, but since I would need API keys, that has been my first tangible step to create the bot. Thus, @Flickolorbot has been officially conceived.</p>
                      <p>Stay tuned for more adventures.</p>

                    </h1>
                    <time datetime="2016-02-12T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">12 Feb 2016</time>
                    <div class="e-content">
                      <p>There has been much written about the ~drama~ discussions surrounding the <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org">WordPress REST API</a> and inclusion in core. Or exclusion, depending on who’s take you are reading. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Suffice to say, the gist I’ve gathered is that there are two competing perspectives, one side wants to incrementally add the API, the other wants a fully fleshed out, complete API before inclusion in core.</p>
                      <p>I guess my 2¢ on the matter is this—the core tenet of the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org">WordPress Foundation</a> is “to democratize publishing through Open Source, GPL software.” From what I’ve gathered reading on the subject, the REST API team have the publishing portion of the API covered and ready for inclusion in core. The parts that would come (much) later would be things like the customizer, file editing, more site <strong>management</strong> tools, less about actually publishing.</p>
                      <p>If democratized publishing is still the guiding principle for WordPress the project, then I don’t see how there is any debate. Opening up the methods to publish beyond what has been the only means available for basically the entire life of the project seems like a no brainer to this guy who’s been around it for 11 years this year. No one will truly know how much is opened up until it is in the hands of creative developers and then in the hands of content creators.</p>
