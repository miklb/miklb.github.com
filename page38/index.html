            <p>So I work with a company that uses <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">BaseCamp</a>, which is great.  Each project is easily separated, has it’s own todos, writeboards, etc.  But as someone who works with all of the projects, I get cc’ed on every message posted.  Some require my attention immediately, some will require me to be familiar with the project at some point.  I’ve never been able to manage my time recording for this internal activity, and I know I’ve lost a few dollars because of this. SO today, I’m testing out a new system.  I’ve set my mail app (Apple Mail), to only check mail once an hour.  I then set up a mailbox just for these emails, got a timer on the dashboard, that can be started and stopped, and will start the timer, read the emails, follow up on BaseCamp on any immediate issues, pause the timer, and wash, rinse, repeat the rest of the business day.  At some point I’m going to have to decide that this company has business hours, (I work from home), and not read anymore messages until the next morning, where I can track the time.  I figure after a week or so, I’ll have a pretty good idea of how much time I’m spending on this, and might actually be more productive, as I’m not constantly logging into BaseCamp to see what new has been posted, and reading messages that have already been sent to my inbox.  I also hope that after a week or two, it will be a habit, and I’ll have a pretty good average of the time spent, so I can simply log those hours either weekly based on the experiment.</p>
            <p>I read a ton of productivity blogs, (which can be counter-productive, go figure), and it seems little issues like this always trip people up.  I know that the GTD ethos is if you can do it in under 2 minutes, then do it, but that’s assuming you’re not getting 10 messages an hour, each with their own 2 minutes.</p>
            <p>Hopefully in a week or two I can report back on how the little experiment went.</p>
            <p><em>edit:</em>Funny one of those blogs I mentioned has a <a href="http://lifedev.net/2007/07/procrastination-email-deadly-combination/">little post about email and procrastination</a>, certainly appropriate.</p>

            <p>My previous post mentions BaseCamp and GTD, what I’d really, really, (no, really) like is a way to export my todo’s from BaseCamp.  Most specifically, to the new Omni Focus, or even better, iCal, which then could be exported to some other format, be it Google Calendar, which supports Remember the Milk, or, as I mentioned, Omni Focus. (Which reminds me, I haven’t been using it as much as I’d like, due to the the subject of this post).  Perhaps if my new system works out, I can use the quick add from Mail.app to OF as part of the system…hmm, might just work.</p>

            <p>So quickly I’ve discovered (or been reminded), that using a Mail.app rule to move right out of the Inbox removes the notice in the dock.  Not a big deal, but if I’m away from the computer when the hour is up, I might not see that I have new work email, so I’ve employed <a href="http://www.tonyallevato.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=29">Mail Badger</a>, so that I can create a custom icon notice in the Mail icon in the dock just for that work’s email.  So far so good though with the system.</p>

            <p>It seems that Technorati finally was able to index the site, as well as fix the issue with the site regarding new claims for sites not supported with the their quick claim.  Not sure why I was actually waiting for the claim before blogging more here, but it worked out, as I was out with a medical issue the past few weeks, so timing is everything.  I really look forward to blogging, and now I have no excuses.</p>
