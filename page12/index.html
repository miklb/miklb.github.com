        An Epiphany: How to Finally Resurrect  My Cooking Blog
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2011-01-24T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">24 Jan 2011</time>

    <p>There are probably 6 of you who know me either in real life or online who read my tweets/blog that know that A)I was a chef in another life, B) I have a cooking blog.</p>

<p>Every 9 months or so, I get these grand ambitions to resurrect the blog, but my grandiose visions overwhelm the realities of my daily life, and they never transpire.  That’s not to say that I don’t still love food, that I don’t <strong>every day</strong>  in my current profession as a guy who makes and manages web sites (do they still call it webmaster?) use my experiences as a chef, both in the work place dealing with people and changing focus at the drop of a dime, as well as the art itself.  It’s ephemeral, here today, gone in 20 minutes, a delicate balance between art and science.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/2658524899"><img alt="Still Life-ish" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3154/2658524899_0cc07183aa.jpg" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>The epiphany is, keep it simple stupid.  It may not surprise 4 of you 6 that I read weekly the Miami Herald, NY Times, Chicago Tribune, LA Times food sections as well as our local über cool food writer Jeff Houck.  Not to mention the many tweets and links that come through my streams weekly.  I often want to share these, with a short anecdote, or comment.  <epiphany> That's what a couple of my favorite bloggers - Gruber and Kottke - do already</epiphany>.  It was really the basis of blogging 6-7 years ago.  Then, just maybe then, I won’t feel the overwhelming (self imposed) pressure to write long form. Those can just occur naturally.</p>

<p>My question to the 3 of you still reading this? I should probably not push these to my regular Twitter account, right? I should just tell folks about the re-positioning once it’s done, and let them subscribe to the feed. Possibly create a new Twitter account to push those updates to those who prefer to use Twitter instead of Atom feeds for updates?  Should I link directly to the source article, ala Gruber, or simply link in the post with my anecdote ala Kottke?</p>

<p>And full disclaimer, I do have advertising on that site, that despite it’s languishing in purgatory, pays for a significant amount of my hosting costs.  That has nothing to do with my desire to kick start the site however, but just want to be clear, ads will continue on the site.</p>

    <p>When you’re the son of Steve Earle and your name sake is Townes Van Zandt, you’ve got some pretty big shoes to fill.  Listening to his last two albums, especially the latest, <cite>Harlem River Blues</cite>, I think he’s stepped into them quite nicely.  He’s playing live at the Crow Bar in Ybor tonight. If you don’t have plans, you should now.</p>

    <p><a href="http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/assets_c/2010/11/TempleWilsonDetail-thumb-250x344-2542801.jpg"><img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/olbermann_blog.jpg" class="right" /></a>I’ve said it before on Twitter, regardless of what you think of his political leanings or on air persona, Keith Olbermann is one of the most interesting baseball historians/fans I’ve read.  Regularly during the baseball season Olbermann waxes on both current and past baseball events on his Baseball Nerd blog.  I’m not sure I’ve read a better example than his latest <a href="http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/11/this_just_infrom_1894.html">This Just In…From 1984</a>, showing a possibly never before seen page from a periodical of the time with images of a long lost championship game.  The fact he can give players names and anecdotes for many of those involved lends to the grainy images from a bygone era.  The juxtaposed image from the periodical with one of his own snapshots from the ‘09 World Series truly brings the past and present of baseball together brilliantly (despite it being the Yankees).  I highly recommend subscribing to the blog if you are a true lover of baseball.</p>

        Transmit &amp; Textmate No Longer Sitting in a Tree
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2010-11-29T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">29 Nov 2010</time>

    <p>For years, my work tools/flow has primarily consisted of using Transmit for for (S)FTP, and TextMate for all file editing save for CSS files,  for which I use CSSEdit.  It worked like a charm.  I could be on 3 different servers, jumping from issue to issue, project to project, and never miss a beat. Now I know my hard core programmer friends will say I should be using something like VIM, which I’d love to be that guy, but my skills at modifying PHP would never allow me to work like that.  I like the code completion, syntax highlighting, and <em>pretty</em> GUI of a desktop app.</p>

<p>So this little work flow had become second nature.  I never really thought about it anymore.  For those not familiar with TextMate, associated files in a project open in tabs, ala browsers.  Otherwise, they are simply each a new window.  Originally I was using the <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/06/13/use-tabs-in-textmate-for-remote-files-opened-by-transmit/">Muffin Research tutorial </a>on how to get the temp Transmit files in a TextMate project.  With the excellent update to version 4 of Transmit, a new <a href="http://blog.taenzer.me/textmate-open-files-from-ftp-in-tabs-with-tra">tutorial</a> surfaced dealing with the new way temp files were handled.  I followed along, things worked great. Until now.</p>

<p>After a recent update to Transmit, I realized the temp files were no longer opening as a project in TextMate.  I tweeted about it, and soon after someone from Panic asked me to send a support email.  I enthusiastically did, hoping I had missed something.  Unfortunately, the reply was:</p>
<blockquote>Hi Michael, unfortunately I can’t guarantee that this functionality will return. It’s not something that’s supported by the ODB Editor suite. Really, this is a feature that needs to be added to TextMate in the same way that browsers can be told to open new windows in tabs.</blockquote>

<p>I politely replied that TextMate does have that feature, the associated files just need to be in a project.  Once again, the response was that I should open a feature request ticket with TextMate that files open as tabs regardless of being associated with a project, followed by</p>
<blockquote>We fixed a legitimate bug with editing files in BBEdit and this was an unintended side-effect.  However, it’s unfair of you to claim that this was a supported feature of Transmit as it relied on accessing a hidden cache folder in order to function.</blockquote>
<p>There was an additional suggestion along the way that I could mount the remote servers using the built in MacFUSE technology as folders on my desktop.  I’m not inclined to use that for my work server however.</p>

<p>Additionally, I was offered a refund if rolling back to 4.1.1 wasn’t an option.  Certainly I do not want to be stuck with that version forever, but in the meantime I’ve rolled back so I can continue on my current work flow, while investigating other options.  I’ve downloaded Panic’s Coda application, which is an svn client, FTP and file editor all rolled into one (plus terminal).  I had tested it on its initial release, and didn’t find it anywhere near my existing setup.  I’ve not used it enough in its current form to know if it’s mature enough to compete.  Certainly I’m not a heavy programmer, so a lot of times TextMate can be overkill.  I look forward to testing it further.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, there would be a simple way for Transmit to store the temp files as in the past where TextMate can easily find them as a project.  Or TextMate 2 drops overnight and has built in support for opening files unassociated with a project as tabs.  I’m certainly open to suggestions.</p>

<p>Lastly, let me be clear.  I did not mean to imply this was a “supported” feature, rather it just <em>worked</em>.  James, the Panic support person who corresponded with me over this issue was nothing but professional, polite and honest.  Refreshingly honest.  They make a great product, one that has almost seamlessly fit into my system without even noticing it most days.  I sincerely appreciate their offer of refunding my purchase.  That was never my goal.  I’ve gotten far more value out of my purchase of that application to ever accept the refund, regardless of my ultimate direction.  I just want the perfect marriage back.</p>

    <p>When I was going through a really bad breakup about 10 years ago, a friend gave me two CD’s. Ryan Adam’s <cite>Heartbreaker</cite> and Whiskeytown’s <cite>Whiskeytown</cite>. I still turn to those two recordings when things are going bad. Adam’s lyrics and voice strike a distinct nerve with me, and is the perfect companion to a bottle of bourbon and introspection.</p>

<p>I came across this video of Whiskeytown covering the Gram Parson song “A Song for You”, and it resonates for many of the same reasons.</p>
<iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9hNExzwlhA?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AG7CQ0YugFc?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>This isn’t a video, rather the original by Graham Parsons with Emmylou Harris set to some great old photos of Florida and Georgia (Parsons was born in Winter Haven, FL).  This too struck a nerve.</p>

<p>Only in the last few years have I begun to really appreciate Parsons, but rediscovering this song will certainly spur me on to learn more.</p>

<p>On a side note, the woman playing fiddle in Whiskeytown, Caitlin Cary is awesome in her own right.  If you haven’t listened to a more current project she’s in, Tres Chicas, or any of her solo stuff, I highly recommend seeking it out.</p>
