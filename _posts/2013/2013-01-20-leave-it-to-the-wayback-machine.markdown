I have been lamenting on whether or not I wanted to bring back my old content or start completely from scratch. I'd been leaning towards starting over, but today in Habari IRC channel, someone linked to their blog on the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), which led me to checking this blog. My [earliest records](http://web.archive.org/web/20050319093337/http://www.miklb.com/blog/) are sans any theme. I'm not sure what determined what got cached visually, but the earliest version of this site that [includes design](http://web.archive.org/web/20051030021240/http://www.miklb.com/blog/) got me feeling nostalgic about having had this site active off and on for almost 8 years. Between that old theme and [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20060814212436/http://www.miklb.com/blog/) I think I will work out bringing back the old content.

For reference, I've been running on Habari since September 2008, never looking back.
