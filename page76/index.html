                <p>Everyone in the WP realm is talking about it, and soon the buzz around the net will too, Matt and co. quietly released WordPress 2.0 Beta 1 this afternoon.  Some have wondered the jump from 1.6 alpha to 2.0 beta, but to me, it seems a logical marketing choice.  The buzz among the net the second half of this year has been web 2.0.  Why not cash in on the hype?  I mean, apps like WordPress helped fuel that buzz, that web application movement, why should they not get in on the action?  Web apps like Flock, technorati, delicious, all rely on more tech savvy users, most who now have a blog somewhere.  Heck, Flock tied itself into WordPress.com by working out invites to wp.com for those signing up for the developer’s release.  So I say to Matt, and those who made the decision, smart move, and may the 2.0 wave continue to further the popularity and development of WordPress.  And thanks for sharing.</p>

                  OK, so Big Oil said they didn’t need the subsidy, so Congress, trying to save some money here and there figured, hey, we’ll cut the subsidy then.  Smart think guys.  But then this comes along.  Hastert, playing politics, pushes to extend an expired subsidy for dairy farmers.  Granted, an International dairy board is against the subsidy, and there’s got to be something better to do than hand money over to dairy farmers ‘cause they can’t sell their milk, but, hey, when a Republican Congressman is running for Governor of Wisconsin, and Wisconsin was a “battle ground” state, it makes perfect sense.  According to this <a href="http://www.fsa.usda.gov/pas/publications/facts/html/milc02.htm">fact sheet</a>, The MILC (get it, milk)program is about giving milk producers money if the price drops too low.  Why then, can a Republican government that argues about free trade, and capitalism, support such a program.  Because it’s our food supply??  Not mine, I don’t drink milk.  Will they start subsidizing organic produce?  I’d much rather do that, to lower the cost to me, than give a billion dollars to commercial milk farmers.</p>

                  How to Export your FireFox Bookmarks to Del.icio.us on a Mac

              <div class="e-content">
                <p>This is intended to be a simple tutorial for Mac OS X users.  I’m not a programmer, I didn’t even play one on TV.</p>
                <p>First, head over to SourceForge and grab this <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bkmrk2dlcs/">script</a>.    This is assuming your downloads go to your desktop.  Second, export your FF bookmarks, for ease of explanation, to your desktop as well(make sure you select all the folders you want to export, by default, the Toolbar bookmarks are the only ones highlighted).  You should have a Folder then on your desktop BookmarksToDelicious and your bookmarks.html file (and what ever else you have on your desktop).  Now go to your Utilities folder, and open the Terminal application.  For those who are not familiar with it, you  are now officially venturing into the Unix core that you’ve heard about.
Once the terminal is open, you should see a prompt that looks something like $miklb:~ miklb$.  Where miklb is the User name that you use on your machine.  The first step is to move to the actual directory where the python script is, which is your BookmarksToDelicious folder on the desktop.  Again, this is a bare bones explanation, for non-technical users, so feel free to comment if there’s a quicker way.
To get to the folder, first type: cd Desktop.  The prompt should now be miklb$:~/Desktop miklb$. (Don’t forget, yours won’t be miklb, it will be what ever your user name is).
Next, type cd BookmarksToDelicious.
We are now in the folder the file is we want to execute.  Almost there.
At this point you need to know your del.icio.us user name and password.  For example purposes, I’m going to use the fictional user name of Alice, and password of Wonderland.  Again, this is assuming your bookmarks are on the desktop.  If not, you need to know the full path to that file.  But if you’re following along, the next command to type into terminal is:
                  <strong>python BookmarksToDelicious.py – –username Alice – –password Wonderland –submit –debug /Users/miklb/Desktop/bookmarks.html</strong></p>
                <p>Where miklb is again the username you have on your machine, which is going to be the same as your prompt in the terminal.
If all goes well, you will begin to a lot of action scrolling down the page, and then the actual bookmarks going into del.icio.us, with a line saying “Getting”, then some code, then  	&#38; result code =”done” /,  	&#38; for each bookmark.
The script will put tags on each bookmark with the folder name for that bookmark.  So if you have a folder called Apple in the folder toolbar-bookmarks, that will be the tag structure you get for the bookmark.  You can then edit that in del.icio.us, or, you can redo your folder structure in FF prior to export, which ever  you prefer.
Also note, it’s not neccessary to use the –debug command, I simply included it, as it may be nice to see something happen, and know when it’s done.  Working in Terminal, generally speaking, it doesn’t show anything happening, so a new user may not know what’s going on.  Seeing stuff scroll down the screen helps.  If you run into a problem, you can leave a comment, and I’ll do my best to help, but again, this is meant as a bare-bones-I-couldn’t-find-a-better-option way of doing this, and wanted to share, as I didn’t come across many other explanations.</p>

Much has been made about the no-bid contracts, the mis-management of money by the Bremer lead provisional Authority, and finally formal charges have been levied.  My question is this?  Who their right mind hired this guy Stein to work their in the first place.  Talk about fox in the hen house.  Guy was found guilty of fraud in ‘96, spent some time in jail even.  Hello!!  He even paid some of his restitution from the previous crime with the kickbacks he got for this one.  His wife paid taxes! 3 years late!  I’d love, just love to know who he <em>knew</em> to get the job.  And I’d like to hear how it wasn’t thought out on how to hire people to oversee <strong>REGIONS</strong> without proper background checks.  This wasn’t a low level guy getting a few thousand dollars, this was a guy who got .5 million in kickbacks for fixing over 13 million in contracts, which never really were done.  And the investigator says 50 more are being looked at.  More examples of poor planning by the administration.  Thank God though they were able to “negotiate” the deals with Haliburton months before the invasion…</p>
