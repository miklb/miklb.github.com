For those of you watching the Grammy's (or just following along on Twitter) and not familiar with Arcade Fire, winner of the Grammy for best album (not to be confused with "record") of the year, I give you the song that sold me off their first major <em>recording</em>.

Also, I'd like to note and ask, I'm pretty sure it wasn't planned they'd play another song to close out the show, and the quote from the lead singer after winning, "We're going to play another song because we <strong>like</strong> music," was one of the best digs at the Grammy's I've heard.
