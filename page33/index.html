            <p><strong>Update</strong>: I was just contacted by the customer support person from yesterday, and indeed there’s an Alex and I’ve been credited in my account.  Thanks Alex.</p>
            <p>So I immediately received a comment from an “Alex” who said he was with Media Temple on my previous post.   (He actually left two comments, as they went to moderation, and sent a contact message.)  The <a href="http://miklb.com/give-the-gift-of-down-time#comment-88">comment </a> speaks for itself.  I did that, emailed him, giving the primary domain, and email address for my account.  Two days later, I get the automated emails about my credit card being declined.  Oh, right, I was mugged two weeks before Thanksgiving, and had my wallet stolen, so I had to get a new card.  But wait, weren’t they going to credit me?  I wait.  Another email.  I wait.  This time, an email with a name attached.   I respond, saying, Alex said he was going to be crediting my account.  Is there an Alex?  Was I duped?  No response at this point.  Meanwhile, I couldn’t FTP into my accounts most of yesterday because of some <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/authentication-issues-on-gs-gridcluster2/">Authentication server  problems. </a></p>
            <p>Not that I’m having the greatest success setting up the VPS server I’m testing from SliceHost.  Mostly MySQL problems.  I’m not ready to give up PHPMyAdmin just yet, nor FTP.  But that’s another post.</p>

            <p>Another six months, another disappointment in web hosting.  This time, the popular Media Temple grid-server.  For the past 2+ months, its been one problem after another, with the most recent being an 12 plus hour down time because of a <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/electrical-systems-maintenance-notice-nov-30th/">failed maintenance</a>.  They talk of credits for users, however I’m not seeing one in my account.  A company I work with received the email, however, not my personal account.  So on the heals of this debacle, they are offering <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/2007/12/04/give-the-gift-of-web-hosting/">gift  cards</a> for a years worth of hosting.  As if someone would want to give you a migraine for Christmas.</p>
            <p>Nice timing Media Temple….</p>

            <p>I’m working on a new theme, another open source design port.  Being the impatient person I am, I’ve got a few tweaks still, so pardon any glitches while I finish up the tweaking.  Certainly interested in any comments, I’ll post another more formal outline of the port when I’m done.  This will be available for download when it’s done.</p>

            <p>A bit later than I thought it would be, but I’ve updated <a href="/mzingi">Mzingi</a> to reflect quite a few changes in Habari’s code.  Among the changes and additions for .2 are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>added header and footer hooks for plugins</li>
              <li>added post status class, to allow for styling drafts differently than published posts</li>
              <li>added a 404 template, including a search box on that page</li>
              <li>updated the pagination code and styling on home.php and other multiple entry pages</li>
              <li>added the pingback filtering on comments.  Though a plugin, I'm assuming most people will use this feature</li>
              <li>added recent posts to sidebar.  This code will reflect which page you are on, and show the next five.  Meaning, if you are on page/2, it will show you the posts of page/3.</li>
              <li>added comment moderation code.  Visitors who's comments go into moderation will see their comment marked in moderation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now to make these changes on this design (though I plan on a complete overhaul before the end of the year, so it might wait).  That said, I’m looking forward to feedback, and possibly seeing this go into the default download as another optional theme as has been suggested to me.  I’ll leave that to others to decide, but I’m certainly not against the idea one bit.</p>
