I've been quite lazy in posting to my blog(s), and am testing out <a href="http://www.scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>. I spend so much time of my day in Firefox, it only seems logical to find a solution that would allow me to manage drafts and posts from within the browser.&nbsp; Particularly for asides and tidbits.&nbsp; We'll see how this works out, and maybe, just maybe, I'll actually blog, and not just work on them<br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
