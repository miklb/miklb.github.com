PANTONE® 14-0848 Mimosa, a “warm, engaging yellow…no other color expresses hope and reassurance more than yellow”.  Interestingly enough, COLOURlovers has relatively few palettes <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/search?hsv=&amp;sortType=ts&amp;sortBy=desc&amp;query=mimosa&amp;hex=&amp;lover=&amp;hueOption0=&amp;hueOption1=&amp;hueOption2=&amp;publishedBeginDate=12%2F27%2F2004&amp;publishedEndDate=01%2F09%2F2009&amp;x=29&amp;y=7">tagged mimosa</a>, and of those few are inspiring.</p>
            <p>I’ll admit color and color theory aren’t my strong suit, I tend to rely on Color Schemer Studio and sites like COLOURlovers.  I did put together this palatte based on mimosa.</p>

          <div class="e-content">
            <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3182996039"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3407/3182996039_1eb840cec2_m.jpg" alt="" class="right" /></a>Though the fact that most who know me consider me to be a “Mac fan boy”, over the years I’ve become quite the hesitant buyer due to the common malady of being always afraid of a new and better version being right around the corner.  Add to that my disdain for the requirement of signing a long term contract with cell phone carriers, I have been living with antiquated mobile technology.  That is, until AT&amp;T offered $99 refurbished 8 gig 3G  iPhones in a post Christmas promotion (the offer was only good through 12/31/08).  I figured at that price, no matter what might come around the corner, I wouldn’t feel bitten if a new model came out 3 months after buying.  Couple that with the fact that the non-contract plan I had with AT&amp;T was creeping up close to the lowest iPhone plan, I took the plunge.  The phone arrived already set up, much to my surprise.  I didn’t have to go through any registration to speak of, I plugged it in, named it, updated the software, and it was ready to go.  The phone came with the standard headphones, the USB connector, the wall charger attachment, and I would have never known it was a refurbished item aesthetically.  The refurbished phone even has the same 1 year warranty that a new iPhone comes with.  I haven’t checked on extending the warranty with Apple Care; I’m not even sure if it’s an option.</p>
            <h4>Primary Hurdle</h4>
            <p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ushlambad/1047117363/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1114/1047117363_2a05422ae8_m.jpg" alt="hurdle" class="left" /></a>As I’ve <a href="http://miklb.com/calendar-syncing-lightning-google-and-nokia-e62">blogged about recently, </a>, I have been using Thunderbird 3.0 and the nightly build of Lightning calendar extension, and didn’t want to change that system.  The same issues that I had with the Nokia are present with the iPhone.  However, goosync wasn’t an option for the iPhone.  Something to do with Apple not allowing access to the built in calendar.  Some extensive Googling didn’t turn up many options, save using <a href="https://www.nuevasync.com/">NuevaSync</a>, yet another 3rd party “beta” service.  Some of the initial concerns people had with NuevaSync were sharing their Google username and password, however that’s long since been remedied, as they use Google account authentication.  Meaning, once you register with Nuevasync, you only provide your Google user name, and Google will authenticate your account with the Nuevasync account, no password is ever passed to Nuevasync.  The only downside is if you are already using an Exchange account (for email for instance), you will not be able to also use Nuevasync, as the iPhone only supports one Exchange server synchronization.  Set up for Nuevasync is well documented on their site, straight forward and very simple.  I did have a bit of trouble actually getting the iPhone calendar to sync with my Google calendar, and quite honestly, I’m not sure what I did to finally get it to sync.  Disabling, then re-enabling the account might have been the trick, but as I’ve been suffering a cold, it could have been user error, however, within their documentation, they have several troubleshooting tips and nothing I did was outside their suggestions..  Needless to say, my iPhone calendar is synced to my Google Apps calendar, desktop iCal, and Thunderbird 3.0/Lighting 1.0pre.  Unlike with goosync and my Nokia, there is no need to manually sync the calendars.  Nuevsnyc also supports sync contacts within your Google account, but I have no need to use that service, as I also believe iSync supports Google contact syncing (something I’ve kvetched about previously in that you have to have an iPhone/iPod to enable that feature).</p>
            <p>Moving from calendar, next was email.  I had previously used Apple Mail.app with my Google Apps IMAP accounts, so they synced directly to the phone on first sync.  I did need to modify some advanced settings regarding mailboxes for things like drafts and sent mail, but that’s common when setting up IMAP accounts and email clients.  Google has well documented the settings, so I won’t rehash the obvious.  Previously I was using Google’s mobile mail app on the Nokia, and was a bit hesitant about using the native mail client, but so far I’ve been quite pleased with it, and have no qualms.</p>
            <p>Syncing my contacts, along with email addresses in my Google Apps account was also a seamless process.  It also the catalyst I needed to do a much needed cleaning of my address book.  I’ve been a user of the (neglected) Google service <a href="http://grandcentral.com/">Grand Central</a> for some time now, and though it’s a handy one, it’s support for mobile devices leaves more than something to be desired.  My only attempt to play a voice message via their mobile site failed to play the .mp3, and from previous use on the Nokia, is all but useless.  However, I found a handy iPhone app, <a href="http://ggtenterprises.com/products/granddialer/">Grand Dialer</a>, which allows you to call a contact directly from your address book with your Grand Central number, so for the occasion you need to call a client and do not want to expose your personal cell number, you’re covered.  (Google, if you are listening, please, no, make that <strong><em>pretty please</em></strong> give Grand Central some love, even if that means a nominal monthly fee).</p>
            <p>LIke any new iPhone user, I spent a fair amount of time perusing the App Store.  Again, I won’t rehash the obvious and common popular apps.  I didn’t really test any of the alternatives to the mobile versions of the desktop apps I knew I wanted.  As I use NetNewsWire on the desktop, it was an obvious choice for the iPhone.  My unread feeds are synced with my desktop, so I’m never reading feeds I’ve already read.  Also, for Twitter, I simply chose the ad supported version of Twitterific, same as on the desktop.</p>
            <h4>The Camera</h4>
            <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3183796430"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3318/3183796430_d047f65326_m.jpg" alt="" class="right" /></a>I’d become accustomed to being one of the few people left on the planet to not have a camera on their cell phone, and didn’t think it would be something I’d take much interest in now that I did, but I did explore some of the apps available.  Merlin Mann blogged about<a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/67192250/smoke-break-by-merlinmann-ive-been-trying-to">taking pictures with his iphone</a>right about the time I ordered my phone, so I booked marked the app he mentioned, <a href="http://www.nevercenter.com/camerabag/">Camera Bag</a>.  It was actually the first app I purchased.  My next search for was for an app that would allow me to upload my camera shots to Flickr.  Flickr does have the native ability to email photos directly, however the combination of the email client and Flickr (not sure which does it), the images are resized to 640x480.  Granted if you get a really good shot and want to post the bigger one, you’ve got the image on the camera, could snyc it to iPhoto, and then upload it, but if an app could save that step, why not give it a shot?  So far, the free <a href="http://klickmap.com/">Klick</a> app seems to fit the bill.  Due to the aforementioned cold, I’ve not really explored the Klick too extensively, but I was able to upload a full size image via the 3G network with no problems, though I haven’t figured out if I can add an image to a set via the app.  The other app I’ve download is <a href="itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=298256007&amp;mt=8 ">Dark Room</a> (<em>App Store link</em>).  This app uses the accelerometer for a “steady cam”.  Basically it waits until the camera isn’t moving to snap the pic, which is handy for low light situations.  A case I’m curious about is <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/clarifi">the Griffin Clarifi</a>, which has a built in macro like lens for taking close up shots.  Apparently the iPhone lens doesn’t do well at focusing below twelve inches.  This would be handy as the technology and apps evolve on snapping UPC codes and doing info/price comparison queries.  Also for going paperless, and just snapping business cards, receipts, etc.</p>
            <h4>The Final Frontier</h4>
            <p>Like most people, I struggle with being organized and actually productive, and often fall into the trap of perpetually tweaking a system, rather than actually getting things done.  I’ve yet to find the right piece of software that just fits, seemingly having tried them all, Actiontastic, Omni Focus, Things, the list goes on.  However, I’m leaning towards Remember the Milk, and am testing a combination of using Fluid.app to run RTM on the desktop, and the iPhone app.  I’m not sold yet.  One iPhone app I found is <a href="http://buckaroosoftware.com/CheckOff.html">CheckOff</a>, a relatively simple list app.  What is nice about it is something I’ve not really seen in another list type app.  You can create templates for often repeated tasks.  So each time you want the list, you do not have to recreate it.  I’d actually love to have a desktop app that does the same thing.  I’m still searching for the set of tools that fit like that favorite pair of jeans, and would sincerely love for any and all suggestions.  I’d even entertain scrapping my use of Thunderbird and Lightning if the shoe fit.</p>

              Why Even Call it Second Day Air AT&T?

          <time datetime="2008-12-30T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">30 Dec 2008</time>
          <div class="e-content">
            <p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mrfrosted/240308153/"><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/ups_scooter.jpg" alt="ups scooter" class="left" /></a>So with AT&amp;T offering $99 refurbished iPhones until the thirty-first, I swallowed my bitterness towards cell phone contracts and ordered a phone Saturday morning.  Like 8am on Saturday.  They offered free 2nd Day Air, but stupid me didn’t check the method, I just assumed it would be regular US mail.  I received an email Sunday saying the item had been shipped, which led me to believe even more so that it had shipped Saturday via US mail.  However, yesterday morning, I took a closer look at the email, and saw tracking info.  It was being shipped UPS, and the tracking info showed no movement.  Today I checked it, and it left Dallas at 8:15pm.  So much for 2nd day air.</p>
            <p>Aside from now being anxious to start <s>playing with</s> using my iPhone, (I’ll be in a location that doesn’t have any internet to speak of through the weekend), I’ll be leaving for said trip first thing tomorrow morning, so I didn’t want the phone sitting on my porch until Sunday evening.  I called UPS thinking that I could simply have them keep the package at the Tampa shipping center, and pick it up before I left.  Even if I didn’t have time to activate it, it wouldn’t be sitting there beckoning some noisy teenager to steal it.</p>
            <p>UPS’s automated 1-800 number leaves something to be desired to say the least.  They must have held a competition for the most annoying voice, because this woman’s voice is disturbing to say the least.  I tried the usual “operator” and “help” at the prompts, but each time was met with the recording asking me if I wanted to “trackapackage”.  Yes, a new word in the English lexicon, “trackapackage”.</p>
            <p>I finally found a human via a local UPS Store, who told me the magic word is “representative”, and to just keep repeating it, ignoring anything the automated prompts tried to use to derail me from talking to a human.  This worked, and after a few minutes on hold, I was speaking to a real live person.  This woman, Danielle I believe she told me her name was, said that UPS doesn’t “intercept” packages before their first attempted delivery.  I grumbled a “thanks AT&amp;T and UPS”, and she said to give her the tracking number, and <strong>IF</strong> the package were to arrive in Tampa before 6pm, someone <em>might</em> be able to pull it and I could pick it up this evening.  However when she saw the timestamp on the origin scan from Dallas, she didn’t sound hopeful that scenario would unfold.</p>
            <p>So now I must find a neighbor who can check on the package and hold it for me, which really isn’t a big deal, but had I known that 2nd day Air didn’t really mean 2nd Day air, I would have paid the extra charge to have it overnighted, and avoided the headache altogether.</p>
            <p>Fortunately my Nokia has a pretty good 3G connection, and a decent browser, not to mention Google mail/maps, so I won’t be totally disconnected, not that I couldn’t probably stand going dark for a few days, but I’ve got too much work pending to completely go off the grid.  Plus, I’m really looking forward to snapping some shots of the last sunset of ‘08 and first sunrise of ‘09 for a New Years day post.  The pass on the north end of the island I’ll be on has a great vantage point for taking both, and now that I’m a little more familiar with the little point and shoot camera I’ve got, not to mention sporting a tripod now, I’m really hoping to get some good photos.</p>
            <p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

              Cleaning My Online House

          <time datetime="2008-12-30T00:00:00+00:00" class="dt-time post-date">30 Dec 2008</time>
          <div class="e-content">
            <p><img src="http://miklb.com/user/files/signal_focus.jpg" alt="signal focus" class="right" />I’ve started a draft of a post on getting older, New Year’s resolutions, and where I want to be in ‘09, but an aside to that is I’ve come to the realization that I need to limit the “noise” of my online world, which is the predominate one I live in.  Specifically, the last couple of days that means cleaning out syndication feeds, and not just pruning dead ones.  It means seriously evaluating everything that comes through my reader and determining if it’s a source of information or entertainment that is of value to me; determining if the volume of content justifies a constant bombardment from the source.  Because several items in my reader are of time sensitive nature, I generally have my reader always open, fetching content every 15 minutes.  Only when I’m in a serious crunch mode do I shut the reader down.  I’m sure I could create filters of some nature that only fetched the time sensitive ones at a more regular interval, and the less time sensitive set to a manual updating, however I’ve come to enjoy the steady flow of information throughout the day.  It’s just that I need to hone that stream.</p>
            <p>One thing that’s also become abundantly clear over the last few weeks is that several of the sources in my feed reader are being duplicated due to my use of Twitter (either automated heralds of new blog posts, or manual linking).   Seeing that Twitter contains entertaining and informative tidbits that don’t make it onto most blogs, the obvious choice was to dump the source in my reader, and continue to follow via Twitter.</p>
            <p>Ironically enough, the genesis of this revelation was the result of having <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">signal vs. noise</a>,  and the <a href="http://productblog.37signals.com/">37 signals product blog</a> in my reader, and following <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried">@jasonfried</a> on Twitter.  There is so much redundancy and overlapping between the 3, that more often than not, all 3 would hit my “inbox” within minutes of each other with the same content.  I certainly understand why, as most people aren’t following all 3, so Jason and 37 signals are trying to market and share information to the widest audience.  Unfortunately for those like me, it becomes a nuisances, albeit an enlightening one that spurred a much needed tuning of the throughput.</p>
            <p>Now that I’m in this mode, it also means that I’m shrewdly evaluating all blog feeds.  A perfect example was tonight, Dave Winer’s <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>.  5 photos, in separate posts, with no context.  Rather I should say, no context <em>to me</em>.  Though I generally find his posts about blogging and “social media” thought provoking, whether I agree with his point or not, the majority of his content isn’t germane to my goals and focus.  So out it went.  That’s not to say when I have some downtime, and want to read a movie review from an amateur film buff ( and I use amateur only in the sense that reviewing films doesn’t put food on his table, as far as I know), that I won’t wander over to the actual site and peruse his site.</p>
            <p>Certainly this process is also being applied to whom I follow on Twitter, as evident by this <a href="http://twitter.com/miklb/status/1070037601">declaration:</a>&lt;blockquote&gt;when someone incessantly twitters about twitter, I call the line and unfollow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  This also applies to a few of the more recent people I’ve followed who find it necessary to welcome each of their new followers with a new tweet.  Is there any harm in using all 140 characters and possibly welcoming more than one at a time?  And is it really necessary to welcome them?  Why not just provide good and interesting content in your tweets instead?  Even better, if they reply to something you talk about, bloody respond to them.  That’s the purpose.  It’s not all about you…anyway, I digress.</p>
            <p>Finally, I feel as though I should clarify that I’ve resurrected this weblog as a means to commit thoughts down to “paper”, and affirm to myself why I’ve chosen this path, the one of an online world.  If for some reason it provokes someone else, all the better.  If it provokes a discussion, then I’ve succeeded.  If at worst, I can look back and provoke myself to get back on track, it’s not all that bad a thing.</p>
