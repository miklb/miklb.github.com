                <p>The national media had to latch onto the Rove story.  No matter how many other global events occurred- hurricanes, bombings, pregnant no-talent bleach blondes attending film premiers- the story just didn’t go away.  The question now is, what will come of it.  Already, the lead talking heads from the Dem’s camp are posturing; Henry “Let’s call an investigation at the drop of a dime” Waxman, Harry Reid (who actually has had the most reasonable response I’ve read from the “left”) and now I’m hearing even good ol’ Kerry is waking up from the nap he’s been taking since last fall.  But will all the clamoring, all the rankle, simply be spun as being a witch hunt, or will the Dem’s do the smart thing, and stand back, and give Bush and his boys enough rope to hang themselves?
 <a href="http://www.tinylittledots.com">Tiny Little Dots</a> discusses the media growing a pair, and one would hope that considering the ramifications the case has had on how journalists will be able to do their job, I for one, expect them to take to task the red meat this story is exposing.  But if the “frog march” that Joe Wilson first spoke of is to happen, the patient persistence of the media and left is the only way to let middle America take hold of this, and only then will Bush and co. be forced to take action.</p>

                <p>So it seems with all the speculations in Washington on whether or not Rehnquist will step down, and how Bush is going to stack the court for years to come with conservative judges, the angle is being played that if  he does step down for health reasons, that O’Connor should be nominated for the Chief Justice position. <!---more--> <a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/07/11/politics/politicsspecial1/11court.html">The New York Times</a> reports that a conversation was had between some senators and Justice O’Connor on the very subject and that she said she was “flattered” and that she didn’t say no.  I find it an interesting move, as she’s been lauded by both sides since her resignation, and find it hard to believe that Bush would be able o escape public opinion on the matter.  If she were nominated, it would be a slam dunk conformation, and if she wasn’t nominated, the Republicans would be painted in a light that perhaps the dems could pull more seats in Congress in ‘06.  I wonder what pressure there is now on Rehnquist to stick it out as long as possible,  when just days before the hope was that he’d step down?</p>

Labels like Merge, Matador, Bloodshot, 4AD, not to mention Jade Tree and Polyvinyl.  All done in VBR Mp3 format.  Consider Itunes is $.99 a track, the basic plan offers 40 tracks a month for just $9.99.  You do the math.  Best part is they offer a free trial of 50 downloads, so you can’t go wrong (and I get a kick back for every trial, so help me pay for my hosting while you fill in that back catalog of the Pixies, Pavement, and check out the new album from Daniel Lanois)</p>
