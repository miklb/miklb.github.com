Spent quite some time cleaning things up a bit around here.  Got the site totally xhtml valid again, cleaned up the sidebar (was getting a little garish from all the plugins) and generally tightened up the site.
<!--more-->
  I added a couple of pages (another ego stroke, as I had to completely rewrite the default theme template, little by little I'm understanding PHP and the structure of wordpress).  I've done away with the del.icio.us links, as I've added my very own quasi-version in the form of <a href="http://scuttle.org/">Scuttle</a>.  I still very well may add a links page in the form of recent surfing , or the like, but in the meantime, I'll just add those that really meet the mark to the sidebar. I even used <a href="http://kalsey.com/tools/buttonmaker/">Kalsey's button maker</a> to make the custom buttons for the various validation in the sidebar.
Got to love insomnia.
